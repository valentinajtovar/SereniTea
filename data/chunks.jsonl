I am frequently asked about recov- ery, both by my patients and those close to me, those who witnessed the transformation that took place in my own life as a result of the recovery process. I had promised myself that were I truly to recover from anorexia nervosa, I would someday communicate to others who also suffer from eating disorders the “how” of recovery. I had imagined a step- by-step approach that would somehow end the terrible obsession. 13 Recovery margaret goldkopf-woodtke ForalongmomentIstoodbeforemyownimage,comingtoknowl- edgeofmyself.SuddenlyIsawallIwassupposedtobebutwasnot— taller, more ethereal, more refined, less hungry, not so powerful, much less emotional, more subdued, not such a big talker; a more generous, loving, considerate, nurturant person; less selfish, less ambitious, and far less given to seeking pleasure for myself. Now, however, all this came into question: Who, I wondered, had made up this ideal for women? Who had imposed it, and why hadn’t I seen through it before? Why, for that matter, did I imagine a slender body would bring me these attainments, even if I decided I actually wanted them for myself?

I hope that by discussing my own recovery,\nas well as describing how that journey now aids me in my work with\nea ting disordered patients, I will provide useful information to the\npr actitioner and hope for patients and their families.\nTh e pain of recovery is difficult to describe, the raw exposure that\nco mes from peeling away layers of feelings. Be cause no step-by-step\nap proach exists, knowing exactly where to begin is difficult.\nI believe four basic ingredients are necessary to provide fertile\ngr ound for the recovery process to occur. Ac ceptance that a problem\nex ists, combined with a desire to get well, inner strength, and hope,\nwe re central elements to me, and these same elements are often\nex pressed by other recovered persons. Al l four may not be present at\nth e start but do surface as recovery progresses.\nAc ceptance needs to occur at two different levels of understand-\nin g: (1) recognizing that one has a problem; and (2) admitting that\non e cannot deal with this problem alone. Fo r someone with an eat-\nin g disorder, arriving at these levels of understanding can be devas-\nta ting. Fr equently the eating disordered patient up to this point has\nof fered the persona of the well-put-together individual. Th is is the\npe rsona she feels she must give to her world.

Mont hs may\npass before a patient can let down her guard. Trus ting the therapist\ndoes not come easily, especially if that trust has been violated in the\npast .\nPati ents often come to treatment because they have been forced\nor c oaxed. They have not yet accepted the fact that they have an eat-\ning disorder. Thei r priority is to be thin, and they believe they are\nfat. Alth ough this perception of themselves may be distorted, it is\nthei r perception. I un derstand its reality. I sh ared that perception\nmyse lf.\nI ca n tell you from personal experience that the attempt simply to\neras e that perception is neither helpful nor possible. That self-\nimag e, that distorted image, is clung to vigorously. To m e those per-\ncept ions were everything; without them I was nothing. My b ody was\nmy o nly way of expressing my dissatisfaction with my life. By n ot\neati ng I felt a sense of power; by the feeling of hunger, a sense of\ncont rol. When life felt “crazy” around me, when my parents fought,\nwhen my opinion differed from someone else’s, when I felt angry\nand unable to express my anger, I starved myself and felt in control.\nBeca use it is counterproductive to impose my own perception on\na pa tient, I find it more beneficial to address the unhappiness the\npati ent brings into treatment. Ofte n the patient is unhappy for hav-\ning to seek help. An e ating disorder is a symptom of something\ngoin g wrong in a person’s life.

My con trol over my\nown th erapy is what ultimately empowered me to keep going, to\nlearn about myself and my needs. It was as though my therapist and\nI join ed forces to sift through the “stuff” in my life.\nI admi t one is tempted at times to take that power away from\npatien ts, especially when they present as helpless. Unfort unately this\nloss o f power is often what they have experienced in their lives and\nwithin their families. To avo id reproducing this experience in ther-\napy is difficult. Recogn izing it when it does occur, however, is essen-\ntial. Therap ists, in their attempt to avoid overprotecting their\npatien ts, are often somewhat detached as a result. This i s a delicate\nbalanc e that must be achieved in the therapeutic alliance.\nIn my experience, feeling powerless created a feeling of helpless-\nness, and underneath it all was a great deal of anger. Anger was a dif-\nficult emotion for me to identify, admit, or express. Anger in its most\npassio nate form is rage, which is not considered an attractive trait in\na woma n. I was afraid of my anger, afraid of how potent it could be.\nAnger and eating were intimately tied. If I a te I was convinced I\nwould be fat. If I l et my anger out, I felt I might explode.\nTherap y provided me the setting to explore this very real emotion\nof ang er and this very real part of myself. A long time passed before\nI coul d talk about my angry feelings without defending the objects of\nmy ang er. I fear ed that if I expressed what I felt, I would alienate\nthose I needed most, including my therapist. Explor ing my anger was\ndiffic ult but ultimately helped me feel safer and less helpless.\nHope i s another essential ingredient to recovery. Exactl y where\nthe ho pe comes from is difficult to explain. For me , the feeling of\nhope c hanged and grew in intensity as I changed and grew. Initia lly\nit cam e from without, from the external changes in my life, along\nwith m y new working relationships with therapist, doctor, and nutri-\ntionis t. Eventu ally it came from within, from all I learned to accept\nand ap preciate within myself.\nSome p atients go from therapist to therapist or situation to situ-\nation searching for hope. I can remember clearly leaving an initial\nsessio n with a new therapist, the one who ultimately journeyed with\nme, kn owing I felt something different.

Many cha nges were occurring simultaneously, which were\nactually providing me with more control and more possibilities. I\nhad ma de a life choice that was not healthy for me. It follo wed a\nlong-sta nding pattern of pleasing others and an inability to look at\nmy own n eeds. This the me is not uncommon for anorexics or bulim-\nics. Onc e I d ecided to reexamine that choice, I uncovered a whole\nrange of emotions and possibilities. This was extremely frightening,\nas it wa s a major risk for someone uncomfortable with the unknown.\nHowever, it was a step I needed to take in my desire to get well. I\nunders ta nd now that there was much more to me than the pain and\nconfusio n I had known for years, or I could never have taken such a\nmajor st ep.\nAlong wi th my individual therapy, I also began nutritional coun-\nseling, group therapy, and medical observation, which included the\nuse of a n antidepressant. All this provided a support system I had\nnever al lowed myself. Though I had been struggling for years, I had\nnever fu lly accepted the fact that I could not handle the situation\nalone. I was st ill trying to keep from burdening others. Now I fo und\nmyself a t a different place, the threshold of recovery. I felt a fraid,\neven of the possibility of getting well, but, for some undefined rea-\nson, the act of giving in gave me hope.\nThis hop e grew as I learned about myself in therapy, in a rela-\ntionship with someone who gave me permission to be in this fright-\nening an d painful place, someone who was not afraid of my feelings,\nand, mor e important, was not overwhelmed by me. My thera pist\ngently h elped me to peel away the layers of unexpressed emotion\nand to e xperience myself and my body in a healthier and more\nappropri ate way. The warm th I felt toward her allowed me to begin\nexplorin g what it meant to become a woman.

Somewhere along the developmental\nline, a pe rson with an eating disorder learns or interprets that these\nemotions a re not okay, that you are somehow defective if you feel or\nexpress th em. To keep fr om feeling and to be in control at all times\nbecomes a constant struggle. No wonder patients have difficulty\nidentifyin g, let alone expressing, what they are feeling.

Only after a long while did I not feel the urge to return\nto old patte rns or means of control, and when I did, that too became\nuncomfortabl e. Nothing work ed anymore. Running from my feel-\nings became as uncomfortable as feeling them. Now I had ch oices,\nand this was progress. Progress, ho wever, was frightening.

I wanted a qui ck fix, but when the\nother doctors offered me that, I felt misunderstood and alone.\nFinally someon e understood. She did not ne gate or ignore my\nsymptoms. In f act, she f ocused on them and let me know they were\nreal. She did not st op there. Once I felt li stened to, I allowed her to\nhear my pain a nd she helped me look at my options. I had wanted\nm y therapist t o take away my sadness, as I now wanted my doctor to\ntake away my s ymptoms.\nMy relationshi p with all three of these helping professionals was\nunique and pow erful. Each was expos ing, challenging, and support-\nive. It was ex posin g to have to get on a scale. It was exposin g to have\nto discuss wha t I ate. It was exposin g to have to express what I felt. I\nsay all this t o reinforce the importance of integrating the mind and\nbody. Symptoms get p layed out in all aspects of a patient’s life. To\nseparate th ese pieces seems futile.\nDiscussing one ’s symptoms in therapy, individual or group, is\nsomewhat contr oversial. Patients have told me that a previous ther-\napist did not allow or believe it useful to spend time or energy in this\nrealm. Althoug h going directly to the underlying issues can be valu-\nable, ignoring the symptoms and how a patient feels about those\nsymptoms is mi ssing a crucial part of the recovery process. An essen-\ntial aspect of therapy is respect for where the patient is. Some\npatients need to talk about their symptoms; others avoid it. No hard\nor fas t rule e xists except to flow with the patient.\nAs I discussed above, initially the obsession, the symptoms, and\nthe behaviors feel like the source of the major discomfort.

Her\nacceptance h elpe d to ease my shame and helped me to address it.\nTherapists must be aware of their own feelings about the behav-\niors that an eat ing disordered patient brings to therapy.

Losing the weight was like losing\nmyself. I was also sending out a signal that something was wrong. As\nashamed as I wa s, I wanted someone else to see my pain and to help\nme with it. I want ed to be und erstood. I wanted to know t hat I was\nloved and accepted no matter what.

It took growing, i n every sense of the word.\n“As a child she is praised and rewarded with approval for being\n‘good’ when she pu ts on a smiling and cheerful face. No attention is\npa id to the painfu l underlying misery, of which she too is scarcely\naware” (Czyzewski and Suhr 1988).\nGrowing up is not an easy process, but the attempt to arrest that\nprocess is even mo re difficult.

In a\nnutshell, gro wing up can be overwhelming and has much in com-\nmon with recovery.

As she struggled to\nmo ve through her guilt and shame in order to allow herself to feel\nangry at this woman wh o had been unable to meet her needs as a\nchild, I too found mys elf struggling.

During my pregnancies, I once again had to\nexperience my body growi ng and changing. Much of the time dur-\nin g the early months of pregnancy I had little or no control over how\nI felt physically. This brought back horrib le memories and feelings\nat a time when I was sup posed to be happy and full of life.\nOnce again, I experience d the disappointed looks from those who\nloved me and found it di fficult to tolerate my feelings. I recognized\nhow easily I had slipped back into taking so much care of everyone\nelse. The difference thi s time , as a recovered person, was that I could\ncall on the resources I had developed through therapy; I knew I\nneeded to take care of m e, whatever the cost. My response to the sit- uation was a healthier o ne, though the conflict was just as painful.\nI did not immediately in form my patients when I knew that I was\npregnant, although some of them appeared to be keenly aware that\nsomething was different. I seemed less available, and some patients\nfelt I had abandoned the m. I felt guilty that my em otional energy\nwas now turned inward an d that others were getting less of me. Of\ncourse, this is true for all of us in this profession at different times in\nour lives. Again, it is a matter of learning how to use these significant\ntimes productively with patients.\nClinical supervision was essential for me during both my preg-\nnancies as it helped me sort out my feelings. Initially I defended my position on a subtle lev el with patients. In doing so, I avoided t he\nemergence of important m aterial. Once I worked these feel ings\nthrough, I was better ab le to help patients deal with their own feel-\nings of abandonment in t heir lives.\nAbandonment is a frighte ning and painful issue and resonates\nwith many eating disorde red patients.

Alt hough it may be hard fo r eating disor-\ndered patients to believe, it was a wonderful experience for me. As the\nuncomfortable physi cal sym ptoms subsided, I began to feel full of\nlife, in every sense of th e word. I enjoyed my round belly a nd full\nbreasts, parts of my body I had spent years punishing myself for. I felt\nsensual, a feeling I had w orked hard denying. My being exposed in\nsuch a sexual and feminine way created anxiety on the part of my\npatients. It also fostered openness. Some patients were able to begin\ntalking about their own se xuality, their own desires and fears. I, too,\nwas less afraid to venture into this intimate area of concern.\nI believe my fond feelings toward my body as it continued to grow\nwere evident. This in itse lf, I feel, wa s a gift to some of my patients,\nan opportunity to see that other ways exist of viewing and embrac-\ning one’s body as a woman. Becoming a parent has been yet another experience that has\nhelped me grow and let go beyond my wildest imaginings. It has also\npushed old but tons, as wel l as given me new vision professionally.\nSince I have become the mo ther of two enchanting daughters, my\nability to empathize has g rown stronger. As I watch them grow, I\nof ten wonder if my struggl e to support them through their develop-\nmental stages would be dif ferent had they been sons. My response\nis, I hope not , yet I cann ot help but wonder. Contradictions abound\ntoda y. How do we teach our daught ers to be assertive, strong,\nexpressive, and confident, as well as nurturing, kind, respectful, and\ncompassionate? How do we t each them that when striving not to be\nselfish, one does not have to be selfless?\nToday we tell our children that it is okay to have feelings, that it\nis okay to be angry. But d o we really give them the freedom to\nexpress that anger as they move through stages of growth and asser-\ntion that are filled with frustration and confusion? I believe many\nmixed messa ges are conveye d to young girls today.\nI listen to patients’ pain around growing and separating.

In turn, it has helped me to be more sen-\nsitive to my patients.\nI hav e come to understand mo re fully the pain of a parent who has\nto learn, as I do, that we c annot protect our children from every-\nthing. Knowing when to prote ct or s upport or guide or let go is a\ncomplex part of parenting, a s our own desires to have had these\nneeds met in our own childho od may surface.\nA bit should be added here a bout the family’s struggle. Initially,\neating disorders may get tra nslated in families as just a problem\ninvolving weight loss and fo od. Parents feel helpless, frust rated,\nresponsible, and often angry at the control being exercised by the\nchild because of her illness and symptoms. They need to be helped\nand o ften educated about ano rexia and bulimia.\nPatients often report feelin g guilty about how their eating disor-\nder is affecting their famil y. At the same time they are cr ying out for\nhelp—for themselves and for their family. In therapy they may talk\nabo ut the pressure they feel to be the model child or their desire to\nmake everyone happy. They wa nt to be separate yet fear the thought\nof it. They have a difficult time o wning their right to life and enjoy-\nment, despite their parents’ plight.\nI thought that getting the p erspective of a mother who experi-\nenced recovery through her d aughter might be helpful.

This fact\nneeds to be mentioned at this po int, as the very process of writing\nthis paper has made me expose my self in a very personal way. I have\nalso spoken to groups abo ut reco very and, in doing so, have dis-\nclosed a part of myself to patie nts. This adds another dynamic to the therapeutic experience.\nAlan Ive y (1983) talks about sel f-disclosure as a skill, one that is\nutilized whenever a therapist us es an “I” statement or expresses a\npersonal thought or feeling: “It is a form of self talk, and the com-\nplex task is in making this self talk relevant to the client.”\nSome patients seek me out becaus e they know my history. My\npresence alone creates a sens e o f hope for them. This, however, can\nturn into com petition, even host ility, especially when therapy\nbecomes more difficult. It is im portant for me not to av oid these\nfeelings. Avoidance on both our parts woul d certainly hinder our\nrelationship and our ability to work productively together.\nSome patients who have this so-c alled advantage of knowing my\nhistory (and even some who do no t) will ask indirect questions or\nmake general comments, as if sea rching for something. It is as\nthough their connection to me wi ll somehow magically make things\nbetter.

I am a lways\nangered to hear a coll eague make d erogatory statements about an\neating disordered patient or to re ad material that does the same; for\nexample, the statement “I hate wor king with these patients; they are\nso manipulative and deceptive” or “All eating disordered patients are\nborderline.”\nOn one level I admit that it hurts and saddens me that this disor-\nder is so misunderstood. Perhaps t he basic drives and fears that must\nbe addressed in therapy provoke to o many uncomfortable feelings.\nPerhaps the patient’s feelings of worthlessness are too much for the\ntherapist to bear. Whatever the re asoning, I believe we should be\nmore cautious when responding to o ne another, checking our own\nreactions before speaking or actin g them out. We owe this respect to\nour patient s and to one another. I began this paper by stating that I am often asked about recovery.\nMore specifically, I am asked how I knew I had recovered. One of my\nhopes in writing this pa per is tha t the reader will come to understand\nthe complexity of that question.\nH ad I recovered once I gained back enough weight to have my\nmenstrual cycle return? Had I reco vered once I could toler ate wear-\ning bigger sizes? Had I recovered when I happened to glance at my\nchart in the doctor’s office, whic h read, “Diagnosis—Anorexia Ner-\nvosa/Recovered”? Had I recovered w hen I could expre ss anger\nappropriately? Had I recovered whe n I could start making impor-\ntant life decisions based on my ne eds? Had I recovered when I could\nliste n to my hunger? Had I recover ed when I could toler ate uncom-\nfortable feelings without starving myself? Had I recovered when I\ncould laugh again?\nThe best answer I can offer to all these questions is that all these\nexperiences were a part of my reco very, and not necessarily in the\norder I wrote them. They happened. Through therapy, th rough\ncommitmen t to my own well-being, a nd through support, recovery\nhappened!

Any cli- nician working with eating disordered patients quickly becomes aware that the range and intensity of their symptoms and eating behaviors vary widely. A psychiatric consultation may be indicated for those patients whose symptoms are persistent or severe, whose clinical presentations are complicated or atypical, who present with symptoms of other disorders along with their eating symptoms, or who fail to respond to conservative management. The consultation can help to clarify diagnostic questions and may help to guide the treatment more effectively. In some instances the consultation can result in the prescription of medication that can advance the treat- ment.

Th ey may be fearful that the referral is an indication that the\nea ting disorder is extremely serious or that the patient is suffering\nfr om some additional serious mental illness. So metimes that may\nin deed be the case because the patient’s symptoms are more serious\nor more resistant to treatment. Ho wever, as noted above, for oth-\ner s the referral is often not so much because the clinician feels the\npa tient is deeply disturbed but because of a sense that the patient’s\npr oblems are in some ways puzzling and difficult, and that another\npe rspective may be useful. Th e psychiatric consultant may provide\nth is new perspective in a single consultation or may become a\nme mber of the treatment team, prescribing and adjusting the dose\nof medications that help to relieve symptoms and speed recovery. It is important to recognize that the psychiatric consultant will not\nsu pplant the primary clinician nor control the treatment’s overall\ndi rection. Th e consultant gives advice and makes recommenda-\nti ons in collaboration with the other members of the treatment\nte am, but final responsibility for the patient must rest with the pri-\nma ry clinician.\nEv en in comparatively uncomplicated eating disordered\npa tients, psychiatric consultation may play a useful role. Th is is\npa rticularly true for patients suffering from bulimia. Su bstantial\nre search evidence and much clinical experience has demonstrated\nth at many (but not all) bulimic patients are helped by treatment\nwi th antidepressant medication. It is not clear why this should be\nso , and it does not mean that bulimic patients who respond to the\nan tidepressants are clinically depressed.

Pati ents and parents are entitled to a\ndeta iled explanation of the pros and cons of a medication trial–a\n“ris k/benefit” analysis. Only if it is clear that medication might sub-\nstan tially benefit the patient and enhance other aspects of treatment\nshou ld it be considered. This should be true for any prescribed med-\nicat ion, whatever the nature of the illness.\nOfte n patients and families are more concerned about medica-\ntion s used to combat psychiatric illnesses than they are about med-\nicat ions used for medical illnesses. Ther e is often a fear that using\nmedi cations to assist in the treatment of psychological problems\ninvo lves some fundamental alteration of the patient’s personality or\nself hood.\nThe use of psychiatric medication may be seen as “using drugs to\nalte r one’s mental state.” In t his conception, medication for a psy-\nchol ogical problem is viewed as using a chemical to solve a behav-\niora l problem that should be solved by the patient’s willpower and\nunde rstanding—a medical form of drug abuse. Othe r patients fear\nthat the medication will fundamentally change their experience of\nthem selves, effectively making them into someone not authentically\nthem selves. Stil l others are concerned that they may become\ndepe ndent on the medication indefinitely in order to control their\neati ng symptoms.\nIn f act, there is little to warrant these kinds of concerns. The anti-\ndepr essants are not drugs of abuse—they do not create a euphoria or\n“hig h” and they do not cause psychological dependency or addic-\ntion . Ther e is no evidence that they in any way fundamentally alter\na pe rson’s sense of self. Ther e is also no evidence that these medica-\ntion s produce long-term harm. Earl y reports that some antidepres-\nsant s predisposed certain patients to suicidal behavior proved\nunfo unded. Anti depressants are generally intended for use over a\nlimi ted period of time while the treatment progresses. Ulti mately,\nwhen eating symptoms have been under control for a reasonable\nperi od of time, the medication can usually be gradually tapered and\ndisc ontinued.

The SS RIs\nare ge nerally safe and well tolerated. They a re not habit forming,\ninduce no dependency, and do not produce a euphoria or “high.”\nThe mo st common side effects are gastrointestinal, such as upset\nstomac h or diarrhea. In a f ew cases, these agents may cause\npatien ts to feel anxious or “jittery,” whereas others may find them\nsedati ng. In a m inority of patients, these medications may reduce\nsexual desire and can also interfere with sexual responsiveness. For\nmo st p atients the side effects are minimal, and many disappear\nwith t ime.\nEating disordered patients are often particularly concerned about\nthe po ssibility of medication inducing weight gain. Genera lly this is\nnot a problem with the SSRIs. In som e patients they may cause a\nsmall initial weight loss, though this is usually temporary. Weight gain i s not a common side effect of these medications. Genera lly the\npsychi atrist can minimize side effects by altering the dose or by\nswitch ing to a different medicine if necessary.\nGiven all these factors, most clinicians treating patients with\nsevere or persistent bulimic symptoms will recommend a trial of an\nSSRI.

Since most clinicians prefer to begin antide-\npressa nt treatment at a low dose and raise the dose gradually to a\nlevel that is maximally effective, an antidepressant trial often takes\nfour t o six weeks. It is important to note that not all patients are\nhelped by these medicines. When a reasonable trial of the medica-\ntion i ndicates that it is ineffective, it is discontinued.

Th e focus of\nre covery is the process of understanding the sources of the stress in\nth e family and finding healthy ways to deal with it.\nFa mily therapists focus on stress in the family instead of stress in\nth e individual with the eating problem because they base their inter-\nve ntions on systems theory. Sy stems theory tells us that all parts of a\nsy stem are interrelated, that one part of a system cannot be under-\nst ood without knowing the other parts, and that the whole is greater\nth an the sum of the parts.\nA way of conceptualizing the tenets of systems theory is to envi-\nsi on a mobile hanging from the ceiling, all of its pieces intercon-\nne cted and moving in relation to one another. If we change one\npi ece of the mobile, the whole structure will be thrown out of kilter.\nTo get the mobile back into equilibrium, we would have to remove\nor add another part or adjust the position of the parts (Richardson\n19 84). Th e point is that we cannot know the effect of changing one\npi ece without viewing it as a part of the whole.\nA family is another example of a system. In our society we define\na family as a system of individuals who have come together through\nbi rth and marriage and whose interrelatedness extends backward\nen compassing all past generations.

When a\nfami ly therapist asks a family member to change a way of behaving\nor a sks a family member to realign a relationship, the request in no\nway implies blame for the problem. To t he contrary, it implies con-\nfide nce in the ability of that family member to be an agent of change\nin t he family.\nTo u nderstand and treat an eating disorder, three levels of systems\nneed to be addressed.

Miss America contestants\nand Playboy Bunnies have gotten progressively thinner in our gen-\nerat ion (Garner et al. 1980 ).

When p eople try to diet to\na weig ht below their biologically determined weight in order to con-\nform t o the cultural ideal, the physiological response is starvation.\nThe an orexic is in a constant state of starvation. In bul imia, periods\nof sta rvation alternate with periods of bingeing and purging. The\nfo llow ing gives us an understanding of what happens when people\ndo not eat.\nA famo us study by Keys, Taylor, and Grande (1950) at the Uni-\nversit y of Minnesota indicated that when young, healthy, psycho-\nlogica lly normal men cut their caloric intake by half for six months\nand lo st 25percent of their body weight (similar to what takes place\nin ano rexia nervosa), they developed a range of bizarre symptoms: a\nconsta nt preoccupation with food and difficulty concentrating on\nanythi ng else; tendencies to hoard food and to spend hours binge-\ning; p roblems with depression, irritability, outbursts of anger, anxi-\nety, n ervousness, apathy, and low sexual desire; and trouble with\nalertn ess, comprehension, and judgment. Physic al symptoms\ninclud ed sleeplessness, dizziness, headaches, hypersensitivity to\nnoise and light, reduced strength, poor motor control, edema, and\nvisual disturbances. These symptoms are the same as those seen in\nclient s with eating disorders.

To carry out these tasks, a family and its members\nneed ord er (or predictability) and balance. As with any other system,\na family will resist change and in the face of change will gravitate\ntoward r eestablishing order and balance. “Order” refers to the fam-\nily’s pr edictable patterns of behaving and reacting, as well as the tra-\nditional roles played by members of that particular family.\nThis all -important order in the family is achieved by “family\nrules.” Family r ules are of two kinds, spoken and covert.

In most fa mi-\nlies the s poken rules are adjusted and changed as the needs of the\nfamily and family members evolve during the normal course of the\nlife cycle . The unspok en rules also change, but with more difficulty,\nsince the family is often not consciously aware that they are operat-\ning under these particular rules.\nAll famili es operate with both kinds of rules. A rule onl y becomes\na problem when it inhibits family members from dealing directly\nwith stres s or anxiety. When such a prohibition has been in effect for\na number o f generations, stress builds up and becomes part of the\nfamily her itage, which is passed down from generation to generation\nmuch like family heirlooms. Stress bui ldup is not a direct result of\nthe pain a nd losses the family encounters over the generations.\nRather, it results from the effect of the stressful events on the rela-\ntionships within the family. And this e ffect is dependent on the fam-\nily rules for handling stressful events.\nSources of Stress in the Family\nFamily the rapists work with the family to understand what is stress-\nful and ho w the family deals with it. I ask fami lies to imagine a stress\nbucket tha t sits in the middle of the living room floor. All the st ress\nexperience d or inherited by each family member is poured into the\nbucket. A symptom in the family, such as an eating disorder, is an\nindication that the bucket has overflowed. The family has developed\nstress bui ldup. For the pu rpose of organizing our thinking we can\nlook at st ress as coming from three main sources.\nPredictabl e family life-cycle stress.The first source results from pre-\ndictable f amily life-cycle stages (Carter and McGoldrick 1989).\nThese stre ssors are normal and expected, and result from the fam-\nily’s evol ution over time. Therapy wi th families has shown that cer-\ntain stage s of the family life cycle are particularly stressful: birth of\nthe first child, children in adolescence, and children maturing and\ngoing off on their own.

In addition, as husband\nand wife tak e on parental roles, they find that the relationship with\ntheir own pa rents is changing to include their own roles as parents\nand their pa rents’ new roles as grandparents. All this cha nge is nor-\nmal, but it is stressful. There will b e a period during which the fam-\nily mobile i s out of kilter as a result of the birth. In time, as new ways\nof relating to one another are developed, the family mobile will find\nbalance in i ts altered state and the family can again go about its busi-\nness.\nUnpred ictabl e stress.The second category of stress results from\nunpredictabl e events that take place in the family’s environment,\nsuch as illn ess, war, or financial setbacks like the loss of a job. This\ncategor y inc ludes daily tensions like someone being mean to a fam-\nily member o r having a bad day at the office or at school. All these\nco ncerns, ma jor and minor, land in the family stress bucket. How-\never, e ach t ime a family member copes with stress in a healthy way\nby changing the situation that caused the stress or by negotiating a\nsettlement w ith someone who made him or her angry or even by just\nhaving a goo d cry and letting the hurt go, stress is ladled out of the\nbucket.\nInhe rited st ress.The third source of stress results from painful situa-\ntions that w ere not laid to rest in previous generations and are passed\ndown to the next generation. This stress is made up of all the hurts,\nlosses, and angers that have been experienced by previous genera-\ntions but ha ve not been worked through to an understanding or\npeaceful res olution.\nAn extreme e xample is a family with a history of loss in the Holo-\ncaust. I hav e encou ntered five anorexic girls during the last several\nyears who ha ve a history of loss through the Holocaust in their\ngrandparents ’ generation.

Although it is not uncommon t o encounter a history of extreme tragedy in families\nof persons wit h eating disorders, a simple cause-and-effect relation-\nship should no t be assumed. Development of an eating disorder is\nfar more compl ex than that would imply.\nAs unprocessed emotional issues in one generation are passed to\nthe next, stre ss builds up. Further, the m ore anxiety and stress that\nis passed down in a family, the more vulnerable that family is to\nadded stress f rom the family life cycle or unexpected events and the\nmore likely th at someone in the family will develop a symptom.\n(Sometimes one can only guess why one family member develops\nthe symptom ra ther than another. Why the sympto m that develops\nis an eating d isorder is often a mystery, although it can be related to\nthe importance the family places on food or appearance.)\nFamily therapi sts assume that stress buildup is related to faulty\ninteractions b etween people. The closer peo ple are to one another\nemotionally, t he greater the possibility of stress buildup in the pres-\nence of rigid family rules. Sometimes indi viduals are unable to deal\ndirectly with hurt or anger because of circumstances beyond their\ncontrol or bec ause family rules prohibit them from working through\nissues. When t he perso ns directly involved do not deal directly with\ntheir hurt or anger, for example, on a one-to-one basis, the pain can\nbe relieved by triangulating, that is, bringing in another person or\npersons. This unconscio us and natural process relieves the stress in\nthe original p arties but often results in transferring stress onto the\nthird party. T his process o f triangulating is the way stress is passed\ndown through g enerations or among family members.\nThe following is a common example of triangulating: Marge finds\nherself gettin g angry at her husband, Fred, who arrives home for\ndinner later a nd later.

In her family of origin she learned that\nnot only was it not nice to get angry, it wasn’t even nice to feel\nangry.

The tens ion contin ued to build.\nOne way tension ca n be resolved without having to confront the\nscary, painful iss ues between this couple and thus break the family\nrules is to focus on something else.

Children can distr act their parents from the tension in lots\nof ways: by fighti ng, getting bad grades, keeping messy rooms, tak-\ning drugs or alcoh ol, and of course by developing an eating disor-\nder.\nAt the same t ime t hat the tension was building between John and\nAnn, fourteen-year -old Suzy, who was feeling tense and out of con-\ntrol herself, deci ded to go on a diet.

When Suzy stopped eating, Ann and Jo hn began to focus on Suzy. They worried, cajo led,\ngot angry, and had long talks about what to do.

Over time, the eatin g dis-\norder took on the pr operties of an addiction, so that Suzy became\nunable to stop. Thus the initial att empt to establish control over her\nlife, as noted earli er, backfired, and she and the whole family were\ntrapped.\nTREATMENT\nT reating a n eating d isorder such as Suzy’s requires that it be\napproached from at l east two perspectives. One is designed to d eal\nwith the symptom its elf, the other to deal with the underlying\nstresses that contri bute to the development of the eating disorder in\nthe first place.\nTRE ATING THE SYMPTOM I often suggest deal ing with the symptom by putting the person with\nthe eating disorder in charge of her eating. This does not mean\na bandoning her to he r own devices. It requires that a c ontract be\ndeveloped with her a nd her family outlining what is expected of\nthem, how the contra ct will be monitored, and what the conse-\nquences will be for not living up to the contract. For example, she\ncan resume field hoc key once her weight reaches a particular level,\nor she may go on a t rip if she reaches a certain weight by summer.\nContracts should als o spell out clearly the criteria for hospitalization\nand how that will be implemented, if necessary. To help the individ- ual take charge, she is given a support network. Key figures are the medical internist, w ho can provide regular feedback on her progress\nand state of physica l health, and the nutritionist, who can work\nclosely with her on meal plans and, most important, provide her\nwith information and understanding regarding the physiology of\nstarvation and recov ery.

Papers 1and 2of this b ook deal with\nthese aspects of recov ery in greater depth.\nWhen families initiall y come for treatment, the parents are pri-\nmarily concerned with managing the day-to-day family life of a child\nwith an eating disorde r, that is, managing the symptom. It is fright-\nening to observe a chi ld starving. Parents find themselve s going to\nextraordinary lengths to encourage or force their child to eat.\nTara Smith, for instan ce, was fifteen when she became anorexic.\nMrs. Smith spent hours wrac king her brain for foods to buy or cook\nthat would entice Tara to eat. Mr. Smith would bring home the spe-\ncial treats that Tara had always loved, only to have them rejected. In\nthe evening he woul d d rop everything and go to the store because\nTara mentioned that so me strawberry ice cream might taste good.\nOn his return she had changed her mind. He became furious and berated Tara for being so self-centered. Mrs. Smith had fallen into the habit of cutting T ara’s food into tiny bites so it would be easier\nfor her to swallow. Sh e asked the family’s cooperation in adjusting\ntheir dinner time and menus to suit Tara’s schedule. Tara’s brother,\nJohn, had been told: “ Don’t argue with Tara. We don’t want to upset her. Don’t make Tara a ngry; maybe she won’t eat. Don’t say or do\nanythi ng to cause stre ss to Tara.” On the other hand, Mrs . Smith\nfound herself co nstant ly nagging Tara: “Won’t you just eat one\ncracker? What did you have for lunch? Have you eaten breakfa st?”\nThe family’s emotional life had become hostage to the eating dis-\norder. Tara’s parents were ph ysically and emotionally drained in\ntheir efforts to coax Tara to eat. John was angry and fel t that the fam-\nily’s attention was re volving around Tara.\nBecause families often come into therapy describing a situation\nsimilar to the Smiths’ , the family therapist, as the first order of busi-\nness, will commonly tr y to help the family step back from issues\naround eating and let the adolescent take charge. The idea is that\nonce food is no longer the arena of a power struggle in the family,\nthe adolescent will be gin to develop her own judgment and make\nmore responsible decis ions about food (with the support of her\nnutritionist and thera pist). This, of course, is on e goal of therapy—\nthat the adolescent be comes responsible for maintaining the health\nof her own body, a met aphor, if you will, for developing autonomy.\n68\nA Family Systems Pe rsp ective on Recovery\n EBSCOhost: eBook Coll ection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:14:00 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Going to\nhigh school did n ot cause it nor did the fact that Grandmother and\nGrandfather passed down th e family rule: “Don’t talk about dissat-\nisfactions—it might cause conflict.” Nor was it caused by the s ocie-\ntal preoccupation with thi nness. However, even though none of\nthese caused the eating di sorder, they can all be seen as possible con-\ntributing factors.\nHaving so many factors ope rating is helpful in treating the eating\ndisorder. We know from sys tems theor y that if one part of a system\nis changed, the whole syst em is affected. Thus a change in any one\no f the factors may have an impact on Suzy’s eating disorder.\nParents are one of the mos t important influences in a child’s life,\nand therefore they often w ield the most power to effect change in\nthe family and in the chil d. This is why parents are as ked to take an\nactive role in the treatme nt and recovery process.\nThe following is an exampl e of how a family might experience\nsignificant change during the course of therapy:\nI first saw Mary Brown whe n she was brought to the Wilkins\nCenter weighing 95pounds, as described at the beginning of this\npaper.

Yes, the family was experien cing a number of life-\ncycle changes, but so do all families. Talking further, I found tha t\nJean’s father was alcoholic. Her mother, though severely obese,\nmanaged to be the main suppo rt of the family. Jean spent her child-\nhood w orried about her mothe r’s obesity, helping her mother with\nher younger siblings, and be ing very careful not to rock the boat by\nexpressing any of her own wa nts or needs or negative feelings.\nMary’s father, George, came from a family in which the father had\ndied young of lung cancer at tributed to heavy smoking. His mother\nhad been overweig ht, and thi s had been a subject of his father’s\nscorn. George worked hard af ter sch ool and weekends to help sup-\nport the family. As in Jean’ s family, he grew up walking on eggshells,\ncareful not to upset the fam ily’s tenuous balance.\nSusan and Mary had participa ted in triangles for years, which had\nkept the lid on the level of stress experienced by the parents. A par-\nticularly significant triang le in this family worked in the following\nway.\nMary’s father was distr essed that his wife smoked a pack of ciga-\nrettes a day. Jean wanted to stop but was afraid that if she did she\nwould become obese like her mother. Because smoking had been an important issue in George’s family of origin, Jean’s habit caused him\na lot of anxiety.

In addition, she was pleas-\nan tly surprised to find that h er friends at school were impressed with\nher bone thinness.\nAs she got thinner and thinner , she lost the ability to concentrate.\nShe fell behind in school, wit hdrew from friends, was anxious,\ndepressed, irritable, and was even angry and snappy at home, all\nsymptoms of starvation.\nThese symptoms had a marked ef fect on the family. Mary’s par-\nents became increa singly anxio us and frantic about her health and\nher behavior. Predictably, one result of thi s anxiety was to take the\nfocus off Jean’s smoking probl em. In addition, the tension betwe en\nJean and George lessened as th ey came together in a common con-\ncern about Mary.\nIn beginning her treatment Mar y met with a nutritionist regu-\nlarly. All exercise and sports were c urtailed, to be reinstated gradu-\nally as her weight rose. Indiv idual sessions with Mary were directed\nto helping her deal with her f eelings about eating and body image,\nas well as focusing on her own areas of concern. The overall focus\nin family th erapy was to uncov er the underlying tensions in the\nfamily.\nParents who are willin g to exp lore their own sources of tension,\neither in their current lives or those tensions inherited from their\nfamilies of origin (and they a re usually connected), will greatly\nenhance the likelihood that th eir eating disordered child will\nrecover. The work the parents do will h ave the effect of ladling stress\nout of the bucket, thereby fre eing the whole family to deal with the\nmore manageable issues it enco unters during its life cycle.\nIf in therapy the parents can examine and perhaps modify the\nfamily’s rules for expressing and dealing with stress, and if they are\nwilling to experiment with air ing and negotiating their own hurts\nand dissatisfactions, several outcomes can be predicted: (1) the ten-\nsion and anxiety between the p arents will diminish, and this in turn\nwill lessen the tension that t he child with the eating disorder feels;\nand (2) the parents, through t his experience, will be in a better posi-\ntion to teach their child more constructive ways of dealing with her\nown anxiety and stress.\nBecaus e stress is transmitted through triangulating, I can assume\nthat Mary is in one or more tr iangles in the family.

She and her father examined\nthe loyalty conflict caused by t heir discussions regarding Jean, and\nthey agreed to stop talking abou t Jean’s smoking. As Jean began to\nunderstand her own family of ori gin’s prohibition against discussing\npainful feelings and to explore the probable genesis of this rule, she\nbegan to see that this might not be a good rule for her family.

(Of course, co ncurrent focus must al ways be\non alleviating the eating disorder s ymptom.) The person is\n“coached” to understan d the events a nd rules in her family that\nled to unresolved stress (Carter and McGoldrick-Orfanidis 1976).\nShe is then encouraged to approach h er family of origin in a new\nmanner, one designed to release her from the triangulated posi-\ntion. This work has been shown to be a pow erful step toward\nimproving relationships in her adult life. When the person with\nthe eating diso rder is married, ther apy most often should include\nthe spouse.\nThe work done by each me mber of the family of a person with an\neating disorder will have a marked e ffect on the stress level in the\nfamily and the tension experienced b y each family member. Having\nlearned to approach issues wi th one another in a direct manner,\nstress will not build up and the fam ily and each of its members will\nbe free to carry out the primary bus iness of supporting and nurtur-\ning one another’s growth, developmen t, and security. \nReferences \nCarter, B., and M.

What is the “food obsession” about for people who suffer from an eating disorder? Their relationship to food can be viewed as a metaphor for how they connect to the world.

Thus the language in which one frames one’s therapeutic interpretations has tremendous importance. The metaphor chosen to connect experiences that the patient knows with experiences that are effectively cut off, unknown to the patient, must be meaningful. As a therapist, in order to understand my patients, I must immerse myself in the food connection. I must try to grasp the meaning of my patient’s fear through food imagery.

She was at the top of her class academically, was one of the best athletes\nin h er high school, and had just been accepted to one of the best col-\nlege s in the country. She had been suffering from anorexia since the\nage of fourteen, and, although she had made progress in her weight\ngain and had developed insight into the genesis of the disorder, she\nwas still struggling with self-esteem. Each newly acquired pound\ndetr acted from her self-image. She had enormously high expecta-\ntion s for herself and was rigid about her performance, berating her-\nself mercilessly if she did not reach her self-imposed goals and pun-\nishi ng herself physically by starving, stating repeatedly, “If I can’t be\nthe best at whatever I set myself to do, I’ll at least be perfect in my\ndiet . I’ll keep my thin thighs and be the best runner on my team.”\nCogn itive and psychodynamic interventions addressing these dis-\ntort ions in her thinking had little or no effect.\nAt o ne particular appointment, she came in and happily showed me\na wa tch she had acquired over the weekend.

She had stated at one point in\nthe therapy that she felt I had helped her because I was “real,” as\noppo sed to other adults in her life who talked down to her, patron-\nized her, acted “fake.” Amy herself felt “fake.” Most of her adoles-\ncent life had been spent creating a persona that pleased other peo-\nple, and she was thoroughly and sincerely perplexed as to who the\n“rea l Amy” was.

Among its major benefits are alleviating anxiety and ten-\nsion; overcoming exaggerated seriousness; creating an atmosphere of\nclosen ess and equality; providing an acceptable outlet (by the client)\nfor fe elings of hostility and anger; fostering the capacity for self-obser-\nvation ; enabling emotional catharsis (Rosenheim 1977); promoting\nintima cy, humanness, and a more informal working alliance; and, of\ncourse , providing a wonderful and safe means of communication. In\nthe ca se of eating disordered clients, we can add to the therapist’s\nresour ces the use of levity, which shows we are not afraid to poke fun\nat our selves, as well as at clients’ own myths and distortions. We als o\noffer a role model to aid in loosening some of their rigid control and\nperfec tionism (Roncoli 1974). The jo ke, pun, anecdote, or appropriate\nstory can be a teaching instrument of unique efficacy (Rosten 1968).\nA prer equisite for the use of levity in therapy is the therapist’s\ncomfor t with humor.

As men-\nti oned abo ve, humor is a wonderful tool that necessitates not only a\ntherapist who is comfortable with its uses but also a person who is\naware of i ts parameters and risks. Many autho rs have questioned the\nwisdom of using humor in the context of psychotherapy, warning\nabout its possible pitfalls. In 1905Fre ud wrote that humor “has in it\na liberati ng element . . . it is something fine and elevating . . . what\nis fine ab out it is the triumph of narcissism, the ego’s victorious\n94\nThe The rap eutic Use of Humor\n EBSCOhost : eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:13:28 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

But he also spoke to the possibility that humor was a reflection of underlying\nanxiety, bit terness, or unspoken hostility (Freud [1905] 1960). Many\nother a uthor s have questioned the use of humor in therapy. Green-\nson ( 1977) p ointed out that patients can cover hostility and anger\nwith humor a nd sarcasm. Paul (1978) agrees that a patient’s humor\nor teasing i s often disguised hostility, and Kubie (1971) is adamant\nin stating t hat a therapist’s use of humor might stem from aggressive,\nhostile feel ings toward the patient. He adds that , for a beginning\ntherapist, u sing humor could divert the patient’s stream of feeling\nand thought from spontaneous channels, act as a defense against the\ntherapist’s anxieties, lead to doubt about the therapist’s seriousness,\nand distort transference phenomena.\nIf humor or jokes are excessively or inappropriately used, the\npatient may begin to doubt if he or she is being taken seriously. Both\npatient and therapist may, if not watched carefully, resort to the use\nof humor to avoid dealing with difficult, conflicted, or painful areas\nand thereby inhibit the therapeutic process (Haig 1986).\nHowever, whe n the therapist is comfortable with his or her abil-\nity to use h umor appropriately, when the same sensitivity that we\nexpect a the rapist to exhibit in other areas of the treatment process\nis applied t o the use of humor, it can indeed be an invaluable tool,\nespecially w hen working with an adolescent population.\nMy adolescen t/young adult group has been meeting regularly and\nfaithfully f or about nine months.

Karen’s unplan ned joke/pun\nhelped her und erstand, probably better than a “formal/serious”\ninterpretation , the tremendously hostile components of her bulimic\nbehavior.\nIn c onclusion, humor can be a powerful and important tool in\npsychotherapy if used appropriately and with sensitivity. Adoles-\ncents especial ly have trouble participating in the therapeutic process\nif they percei ve the therapist as patronizing and “fake.” Humorous\ninter ventions and banter are a way of lessening their discomfort and\nmaking them fe el they are being treated as equals.\nHumor is, of c ourse, inexorably linked to the therapist’s person-\nality and to h is or her degree of comfort with its usage; but when\nused by a skil led practitioner, it can help patients gain an objective\nview of their behavior, point out the self-damaging effects of black-\nand-white thin king, debunk some of their myths and distortions,\nand, most of a ll, cement the therapeutic alliance.\nReferences\nDri scoll, Rich ard. 1978. “Humor i n Prag matic Psychotherapy.” Handbook\nof Hu mor and P sychotherapy.

At the same time, the exi- gencies of providing psychiatric treatment in this era of managed heath care have necessitated finding clinically effective, yet cost- effective, short-term approaches. One treatment that has emerged is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and a growing body of empirical evidence has clearly demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (Agras et al. 1992; Fairburn, Agras, and Wilson 1992; Garner et al. 1993) and binge eating disorder (Agras et al. 1997). Moreover, although initially thought to be an ineffective therapeutic approach for anorexia nervosa, a number of recent articles have suggested that, with modification, CBT can be successfully used in treating anorexia as well (e.g., Garner, Vitousek, and Pike 1997).

Th e use of CBT in bulimia nervosa was first conceptualized by\nFa irburn (1981), and over the years a detailed and periodically\nre vised treatment manual has evolved (Fairburn, Marcus, and Wil-\nso n 1993), which has given clinicians a blueprint for treating eating\ndi sorders using this approach.\nTh e CBT model emphasizes that both cognitive and behavioral\nfa ctors are at play in maintaining bingeing behavior. Si nce bulimics\nov ervalue body weight and shape, the stage is set for the individual\nto restrict food intake in order to attain or maintain the goal of the\nde sired physical appearance. Th is restriction then leads to being\nsu sceptible to loss of control over eating, which results in bingeing.\nSe lf-induced vomiting and other forms of inappropriate weight\nco ntrol attempt to compensate for the calories consumed during the\nbi nge. Th e purging behaviors persist because they lessen the anxiety\nsu rrounding weight gain. Ho wever, as a result of the binge/purge\nbe havior, the patient feels guilty and suffers from a compromised\nse nse of self. Th is model for bulimia nervosa suggests that treatment\nmu st not only address the presenting behaviors of binge eating and\npu rging but must also assist the patient in replacing dietary restric-\nti on with a more normal eating pattern. In addition, it must also help\nmo dify the dysfunctional thinking and feelings regarding the signifi-\nca nce of body shape and weight (Wilson, Fairburn, and Agras 1997).\nPR ELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS\nAl though CBT has demonstrated a high degree of efficacy in treat-\nme nt outcome studies, certain cohorts of patients would not be con-\nsi dered suitable candidates for therapy (see, e.g., chapter 11below).\nCo -morbidity of substance abuse or dependence would preclude a\nCo gnitive-Behavioral Therapy and Other Short-Term Approaches\n11 3\n E BSCOhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:13:10 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Thes e conditions would interfere with\nthe patient’s ability to adhere to the treatment program; so before\natte mpting CBT, it is preferable to begin therapy by treating the\nunde rlying addiction or mood disorder first.\nTrea tment typically lasts about twenty weeks and consists of nine-\nteen sessions. CBT has three clearly delineated stages: Stages 1and\n2con sist of eight sessions each, and Stage 3is three sessions. Each sess ion lasts up to fifty minutes, and the therapist adheres strictly to\nthe time frame of sessions.\nCBT focuses on the present and the future, and is semi-struc-\nture d and problem-oriented in nature. As w ith all therapy formats, a\ngood therapist-patient relationship is essential for recovery. The pati ent has an active role in the treatment sessions, and the success\nof C BT depends considerably on the patient’s ability to remain\nmoti vated to follow through on homework assignments. The thera-\npist has an active voice in the sessions and provides didactic infor-\nmati on, support, guidance, and encouragement. Befo re beginning\nStag e 1, a thorough psychiatric evaluation should be completed to\nasse ss the patient’s suitability for the CBT program.\nStag e 1 (Sessions 1–8)\nThe two major aims of Stage 1include orienting the patient to the\ncogn itive-behavioral approach and replacing the binge/purge\nbeha viors with a more stable pattern of eating. In o utlining the\nrati onale underlying the CBT approach to treatment, the therapist\nexpl ains the vicious cycle that occurs within the constellation of\nbuli mic symptoms and their interrelationships (strict dieting,\nbing eing and purging, extreme concern about weight and shape,\nand low self-esteem), and how it perpetuates the eating disorder. In\nt he first session the therapist also introduces self-monitoring. The pati ent is instructed to keep a record on a daily food record sheet of\never ything she eats. The time of day, the food eaten, whether a\nbing e or purge occurred, and the associated thoughts and feelings\nare all noted and then discussed with the therapist in the following\nsess ion. The self-monitoring serves two purposes: (1) It provides\ndata for the therapist regarding the patient’s eating style and con-\n114 Cogn itive-Behavioral Therapy and Other Short-Term Approaches\n EBS COhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:13:10 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Areas discussed include\nbody w eight and the concept of the body mass index, the physical\nconseq uences of dieting, laxative use, and self-induced vomiting\n(and t heir ineffectiveness in regulating weight), and the adverse\neffect s of dieting. This d idactic approach is critical as it dispels the\nmyths patients frequently have concerning eating and body weight,\nand la ys the groundwork for altering the patient’s perceptions and\ncognit ive beliefs about food. In add ition, the patient is asked to\nrestri ct eating to three meals and two or three snacks per day.

The goal o f this\ntherapeuti c task is to assist the patient in developing a framework for\nproblem-so lving skills that can be implemented whenever difficul-\nties arise . \nOne of the most common triggers for inducing binge eating is\ndisordered thinking (e.g., believing you are overweight when you\nare not or believing a five-pound weight gain will be evident to\neveryone). Often, how ever, the patient remains unaware of the\nthinking p atterns that contribute to the onset of a binge episode. At\nthis ju nct ure in treatment, the therapist begins to address the under-\nlying prob lematic thoughts and attitudes that perpetuate the eating\ndisorder. The patien t’s concern about shape and weight is especially\nsusceptibl e to faulty cognitive patterns such as dichotomous think-\ning (somet hing is either all good or all bad, nothing in between).\nOther type s of disordered thinking frequently seen in eating disor-\nder patien ts include overgeneralization, catastrophizing, selective\nabstractio n, and magnifying negatives and minimizing positives\n(Agras and Apple 1997).

At the same time,\nhowever, it is important that the therapist point out to the patient\nthat under s evere stress, binge-eating behaviors may be revisited but\ncan be viewe d as lapses rather than a full-blown relapse. In addition, each patient completes a written maintenance plan that can be fol-\nlowed once t herapy has ended. \nCOGNITIVE-BE HAVIORAL THERAPY AND \nBINGE-EATING DISORDERS\nAlthough bin ge-eating disorder was first described by Stunkard in\n1959, it onl y became part of the official psychiatric nomenclature\nwhen, in 199 4, it was included in Appendix B of the fourth edition\nof the Diagn ostic and Statistical Manual(DSM-IV) as an example of\nan eating di sorder not otherwise specified. A number of controlled\nstudies have examined the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy\nin this pati ent group and have found that it is a beneficial therapeu-\ntic approach in the reduction of binge-eating episodes (Agras et al.\n1997; Marcus , Wing, and Fairburn 1995; Peterson et al. 1998). Fre- quently a gr oup format is used in treating obese patients. Therapists\nn eed to modi fy the CBT treatment when working with patients with\nbinge-eating disorder. Such patient s tend to gain weight during\nCBT treatmen t; to prevent this, some weight-control measures,\nalong with a mild exercise program, need to be incorporated into the\nfirst phase of treatment and is monitored throughout the course of\ntherapy (Agr as and Apple 1997). Second, whil e the bulimic patient’s\nmain goal is to stop binge eating, the obese patient primarily enters\ntreatment to lose weight. Thus the the rapist must emphasize that\nthe primary goal is the cessation of binge eating and establishing a\nhealthier ea ting style. Further, the patient must understand that\nmore importa nt than reaching any goal weight is the need to\ndevelop cont rol over binge eating in order to diminish the feeling of\nbeing out of control and reduce a preoccupation with food. Not all\nobes e patien ts are able to conceptualize the importance of working\ntoward a dif ferent attitude while not losing weight.\n118\nCognitiv e-Be havioral Therapy and Other Short-Term Approaches\n EBSCOhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:13:10 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

These include weight preoccupation, perfec-\ntionistic tend encies, starvation symptoms, and faulty cognitive pat-\nterns. Presuma bly, th en, CBT should also be an effective treatment\nfor anorexia n ervosa. A number of ea rly reports (e.g., Garner and\nBemis 1982) ha d suggested that CBT might be an effective treat-\nment for anore xia nervosa. However, Coope r and Fairburn (1984),\nwhile reportin g some success with anorexics who binged and\npurged, found that the restricting subtype fared poorly with CBT.\nThese early re ports were anecdotal clinical case studies that lacked\nthe methodolog ical rigor of controlled clinical trials. One reason for a dearth of re search in this area could be that the incidence of\nanorexia nervo sa is quite low, making it more difficult to gather a\ncohort large e nough to undergo statistical analysis. Another issue lies in the fa ct that the treatment of choice for the extreme low-\nweight anorexi c is typically hospitalization. Thus a therape utic pro-\ngram devised f or outpatients would have to preclude the more\nchronic anorex ic patient and would affect the generalizability of the\nresults across the symptom severity continuum. \nRecently attem pts have been made to describe a CBT treatment\napproach for a norexic patients (Garner, Vitousek, and Pike 1997),\nand clinical t rials are presently under way to evaluate the efficacy of\nCBT in anorexi a nervosa.\nTwo major issu es complicate CBT treatment in anorexic patients\nthat are absen t in bulimia nervosa. These include the level of moti-\nvation for the rapeutic help and addressing the issue of weight and\nweight gain in treatment (Garner, Vitousek, and Pike 1997).\nAlthough motiv ating eating disorder patients can be problematic, it\nis especially arduous with the anorexic. The vast major ity of anorexic\npatients will resist gaining weight, though this is the main goal of\ntreatment for them. Thus the initi al phase of CBT must incorporate\na substantial amount of time devoted to developing and sustaining\nmotivation for change.\nIn CBT, the bu limic patient is reassured that weight gain, if any,\nCognitive-Beha vioral Therapy and Other Short-Term Approaches\n119\n EBSCOhost : eB ook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:13:10 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

However,\nsince t he major goal in treating the anorexic is to gain weight, the\npatient must dea l with the fear of becoming fat while actually\nbecoming fatter (Garner, Vitousek, and Pike 1997).

The social dysfu nction that often accompanies anorexia nervosa,\nthe frequent nee d for family involvement, particularly with young\nanorexic patient s, and a longer duration of therapy (the anorexic\npatient may rema in in CBT treatment for one to two years), have\ncontributed to a n interweaving of cognitive-behavioral and inter-\npersonal approac hes in working with this patient population (Gar-\nner, Vitousek, a nd Pike 1997).

In addition, the longer treatment duration is\nrequired because of motivational issues. However, the bul imic\npatient is also at risk (see chapter 1above).

The major\nu nderlyi ng assumpt ion of IPT is that the development of clinical\ndepression occurs in a social and interpersonal context and that the\nonset, response to treatment, and outcome are influenced by the\ninterpersonal rela tions between the depressed patient and signifi-\ncant others (Klerm an and Weissman 1993). These authors stre ss\nthat there is no a ssumption that interpersonal difficulties cause\ndepression but rat her that the depression occurs within an interper-\nsonal context. The therapeutic st rategies of IPT are designed to\nassist the patient in dealing more effectively with interpersonal dys-\nfunction.\nFour int erpersonal problem areas have been identified. The most\ncommon di fficultie s are role disputes and are typically seen in mar-\nried couples.

It is interesting to note that after the eating dis-\norder was discusse d in the initial sessions (and the discussion centers\non the relationshi p between interpersonal events and the bulimic\nbehavior), it was essentially ignored throughout the remainder of\ntherapy, and the f ocus of treatment concerned the interpersonal\nrealm. Fairburn an d colle agues (1991) found that at one-year fol-\nlow-up, IPT was as successful a treatment for bulimia nervosa as was\nCBT. This finding was a lso replicated in a study of binge-eating dis-\norder using IPT an d CBT in a group treatment setting (Wilfrey et\nCognitive-Behavior al Therapy and Other Short-Term Approaches\n121\n EBSCOhost: eB ook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:13:10 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

These results clearl y demonstrate how profound an impact\ninterpersonal dysfun ction has on the maintenance of these disorders.\nIt is also noteworth y that the onset of many eating disorders is often\nduring adolescence, a developmental period in an individual’s life\nheavily laden with i ssues surrounding interpersonal relationships.\nThus it is not surpr ising that IPT is an effective treatment format for\nbinge-eating disorde rs, since it addresses some underlying interper-\nsonal issues that mi ght have contributed to the development of eat-\ning problems.\nOTHER SHORT-TERM PSY CHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS\nAnother treatment ap proach used for bulimia nervosa is response\nprevention (Leitenbe rg et al. 1988), a behavior therapy that has its\nroots in flooding an d implosion techniques. In this treatment th e\npatient binges durin g the course of a therapy session until the desire\nto purge occurs. The patient then rem ains in session until that urge\ndissipates, demonstr ating that control over purging can occur. The\nunderlying assum ptio n is that once the patient’s desire to purge has\nbeen eliminated, bin ge-eating episodes will be reduced. While the\ninitial st udy showed some promise in the technique (although\npatients found the p rocedure quite disturbing), later work (Agras et\nal. 1989) demonstrat ed that adding response prevention to CBT led\nto poorer results th an when CBT was used alone.\nAnother therapeutic approach used with binge-eating disorders is\npsychoeducational gr oup therapy. This modality is pri marily a\nstripped-down versio n of CBT, since it only includes the psychoed-\nucational aspects. I n a group format, p atients receive education in\nthe areas of nutriti on, the adverse effects of dieting, bingeing and\npurging, and sometim es include discussion on the cognitive distor-\ntions that frequentl y occur in eating disorder patients.

In the initial study, Cooper, Coker, and\nFleming (1994) showed that more than half the bulimic patients\nreported marked clinic al improvement using a therapist-led, self-\nhelp manual.\nWith the advent of man aged health care, impetus has developed\nin our field to identi fy the most cost-effective and easily dissemi-\nnated forms of treatme nt. Fairburn and Peveler ( 1990) have sug-\ngested the adoption of a stepped-care approach in the treatment of\nbinge-eating disorders . This health care deliv ery model involves\nfirst offering a simpl e treatment, since some patients will respond\npositively. The first treatment ti er might be an unsupervised self-\nhelp format. Those who do not respo nd move on to the next step,\nwhich involves more in tensive therapy. For example, it might con-\nsist of a guided self- help treatment. Should self-help prove unsuc-\ncessful, then the thir d level of care, such as a CBT approach, would\nbe required. If the pa tient proves to be a nonresponder, then another\nlevel of treatment wou ld be instituted, such as the addition of an\nantidepressant, partia l hospitalization, or an inpatient stay. Recent\nresearch has sh own tha t this model may be promising for both\nbulimia nervosa (Davis et al. 1999) and binge-eating disorders\n(Peterson et al. 1998) . Of particular i mportan ce at this juncture,\nhowever, is for resear chers to identify patient characteristics that\nmay predict the level of stepped-up care to which the individual will\nrespond.\nCONCLUDING RE MARKS\nThe efficacy of cognit ive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal psy-\nchotherapy has been cl early demonstrated in the treatment of binge-\neating disorders.

Timothy Walsh, MD IMPORTANCE Eating disorders are characterized by disturbances in eating behavior and occur worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 2% to 5%. They are more common among females than males and may be associated with medical and psychiatric complications, impaired functioning, and decreased quality of life. OBSERVATIONSCommon eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. These disorders may be associated with changes in weight, electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia), bradycardia, disturbances in reproductive hormones (eg, decreased estradiol levels in females), and decreased bone density. Individuals with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder have high lifetime rates of depression (76.3% for bulimia nervosa, 65.5% for binge-eating disorder, and 49.5% for anorexia nervosa) and higher rates of suicide attempts than those without eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa is associated with a mortality rate of 5.1 deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 4.0-6.1), nearly 6 times higher than that of individuals of the same age without anorexia nervosa; 25% of deaths among individuals with anorexia nervosa are from suicide. First-line treatments for eating disorders include nutritional support, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. Behaviorally focused therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, may be effective, especially for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. Youth with anorexia nervosa benefit from family-based treatment with parental oversight of eating, resulting in a remission rate at 6 to 12 months of 48.6% vs 34.3% with individual treatment (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.07-4.03;P= .03). Fluoxetine and other antidepressants decrease episodes of binge eating in individuals with bulimia nervosa, even in those without depression (fluoxetine vs placebo, standardized mean difference = −0.24 [small effect size; 95% CI, −0.41 to −0.08]). Antidepressants and the central nervous system stimulant lisdexamfetamine reduce binge frequency in binge-eating disorder compared with placebo (antidepressants vs placebo, standardized mean difference = −0.29 [small effect size; 95% CI, −0.51 to −0.06]; lisdexamfetamine vs placebo, Hedgesg= 0.57 [medium effect size; 95% CI, 0.28-0.86]). There are currently no effective medications for treatment of anorexia nervosa. Individuals with serious medical or psychiatric complications of eating disorders such as bradycardia or suicidality should be hospitalized for treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEGlobally, eating disorders affect 2% to 5% of individuals during their lifetime and are more common in females than males. In addition to weight changes, eating disorders may cause electrolyte abnormalities, bradycardia, disturbances in reproductive hormones, and decreased bone density, and are associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts. First-line treatments of eating disorders include nutritional support, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. JAMA. 2025;333(14):1242-1252. doi:10.1001/jama.2025.0132 Published online March 6, 2025.

Abstract Objective: The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the treatment literature on bulimia nervosa. The available published literature in this area was reviewed. Method: Following computer searches the psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy literature were reviewed in detail. Results: Psychotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for most patients with bulimia nervosa. The most intensively studied form has been cognitive behavioral therapy, although there are also data supporting the use of interpersonal psychotherapy, dialectic behavior therapy and family-based treatments for adolescents with bulimia nervosa. There is also a growing literature on the utility of self-help approaches. Two recently introduced therapies, which are currently being studied, include enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy and integrative cognitive-affective therapy. Relative to pharmacotherapy approaches, antidepressants remain the best studied form of drug therapy, focusing on the use of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Other medications which have been tried empirically include ondansetron and topiramate. Discussion: The treatment of bulimia nervosa has evolved to the point where both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy approaches appear to be affective. Overall remission rates appear to be higher with empirically supported manual-based psychotherapy approaches, although many patients have benefited from drug therapy as well. ‡ E-mail address: Jmitchell@nrifargo.com 2012.

Th ese treatments clearly impact on the course of this \ndi sorder, although further treatment development is needed. \nIn deciding on the proper treatment approach the goal is to provide the patient with the \nsu pport and structure necessary for her to start eating regularly balanced meals and to cease \nbi nge eating and engaging in compensatory behaviors. Us ually this can be accomplished \nef fectively in outpatient treatment settings, but for some patients a more intensive setting, \nsu ch as a partial hospital program or an inpatient stay may be necessary, particularly for \npa tients who have co-occurring severe psychopathology or for those who fail to respond to \nou tpatient care. Su icidality is the most common reason for such an increased level of care. PS YCHOTHERAPY Ps ychotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for most patients with BN. \nUn fortunately, the forms of treatment which have been shown to be effective have not been \nwi dely disseminated to the practice community, and many patients who are seen for treatment \nwi th eating disorders receive treatments that are not empirically validated (1).

In t he late 1980’s this approach was modified for patients with \nBN. Wilf ley and colleagues (10,11) developed a group format for IPT and demonstrated that \nit w as an effective treatment for patients with BED.

The interpersonal roles of particular interest for IPT therapists \ninvo lve the family as well as friends, and fellow workers and those in the neighborhood and \ncomm unity. \nIPT for those with BN is again time limited and attempts to link interpersonal \nrela tionships to eating disorder symptoms. Four social domains can be addressed in the \ntrea tment: 1) interpersonal deficits, 2) role transitions, 3) interpersonal role disputes, and 4) \ngrie f. Gene rally one or at most two of these areas become the focus for treatment. IPT is \ngene rally delivered in 15-20 sessions or 4-5 months and includes three phases. In t he initial \nphas e, problem areas are identified; in the subsequent phase therapist and patient work on the \ntarg et problems and in the final phase gains are consolidated and patients are prepared to do \nfutu re work on their own. \nA cr itical part of IPT is the interpersonal inventory which involves a thorough \nexam ination of each individual’s interpersonal history. This includes an examination of \nrela tionships, social functioning, expectations of relationships and other interpersonal issues. \nThis then leads to the interpersonal formulation which includes the identification of the \nprim ary areas of focus.

The re sults indicated higher rates of abstinence from binge \neating and purging at the end of 20 weeks of treatment in the active treatment group (28.6%) \nversus the weight list control (0%). \nIn gen eral DBT focuses on several issues, including self-acceptance, dialectic strategies, \nstylis tic strategies, core strategies and case management strategies. Dialec tical strategies focus \non dic hotomous thinking and behaviors and emotions. These may include the use of stories \nand me taphors. Stylis tic strategies attempt to balance acceptance and the need for change. \nThe th erapist must convey interpersonal warmth and concern. Core s trategies are those \ndesign ed to promote acceptance and behavioral change and includes such things as an \nexamin ation of antecedents and consequences and behavioral chain analysis.

Only t wo randomized \ncontro lled trials have been published both using a family-based therapy for BN (18,19). In the first of these studies le Grange and colleagues assigned 80 patients with full or subsyndromal \nBN, ag es 12-19, to family-based therapy for BN or to individual supportive psychotherapy. \nBoth g roups received 20 therapy sessions over 6 months. The fa mily-based approach had a \nclinic ally and statistically significant advantage over the comparison group at the end of \ntreatm ent and at six-month follow-up, with more patients abstinent from binge eating and \npurgin g (39% vs. 18%) at end-of-treatment.

The appr oach \nis sympt om focused and includes a strong emphasis on encouraging the parents to not assume \na role o f guilt. The role of the therapist is to serve as a consultant and educator while leaving \ndecision s up to the parents. \nIn the f irst phase of this treatment, emphasis is placed on reestablishing healthy eating \npatterns . The sess ions begin with a brief meeting between the therapist and the patient before \nmeeting with the rest of the family. In the f amily meeting the therapist directs the discussion \nso as to strengthen the parental alliance. The fami ly is carefully educated about medical and \npsychiat ric sequellae of BN.

The seco nd phase of treatment focuses on \nhelping the adolescent establish healthy eating behavior on their own, and the third phase of \ntreatmen t focuses on adolescent issues and termination. \n \n \nSELF -H EL P FOR BULIMIA NERVOSA \n \nThe li te rature in this area has recently been thoroughly reviewed (20-22). The meta -\nanalytic analyses, although hindered by a relatively small number of studies and relatively \nsmall sa mple sizes, suggests that partial self-help or guided self-help approaches do have \nsome uti lity in the treatment of those with BN, and the follow-up results suggest that gains \ntend to be maintained. However, there isn’t as of yet any firm evidence favoring one approach \nover ano ther. However, the study by Walsh et al. (23) found that guided self-help provided by \nnurses d id not add to the effectiveness of anti-depressant treatment, and was associated with a \nhigh dro pout rate. This sug gests that specialist care is probably needed for these types of \ninterven tions. Much of the development in this area has been motivated by health economic \nreasons but also problems with the availability of treatment. Clearly more work needs to be \ndone loo king at such approaches. \n \n \nENHA NC ED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY \nFOR BULI MIA NERVOSA \n \nFairbu rn and colleagues have modified the traditional CBT for treatment to a \ntransdia gnostic model designed to treat people with a variety of types of eating pathology. \nThe full transdiagnostic treatment has been described in detail (4,5,24).

The second stage is \ntransition al in which progress is reviewed, barriers to change are identified and the \nformulatio n may be modified. Stage thre e is the main body of treatment and includes 8 \nsessions. Stage 4 is designed to insure that the changes are being maintained. \n \n \nINTEGR AT IV E COGNITIVE-AFFECTIVE THERAPY FOR THE \nTREATMENT OF BULIMIA NERVOSA \n \nThis the ra py grew out of the observation that CBT does not sufficiently help many \npatients w ith BN. It has bee n argued that CBT might be improved by maintaining a stronger \nfocus on a ffective and interpersonal issues (25) and enhancement of treatment techniques by \nintegratin g concepts for constructivist theories (26) including narrative strategies (27) \nutilizing the therapeutic relationship more thoroughly (28) and placing greater emphasis on \ndevelopmen tal issues (29). In this mo del, greater emphasis is placed on self-discrepancy, \ninterperso nal patterns, self-directed styles of behavior and emotional experience. The therap y \nis deliver ed in 21 sessions. A clinicia n manual and a patient workbook have been developed \nand palm t op computers provide part of the therapy. \nIn terms o f clinical principles ICAT attempts to increase awareness of emotional \nresponses, identify situations that frequently illicit prominent emotional responses and to \nmodify act ion tendencies in the face of situation-emotion units. It is deli vered in four phases. \nThe first is characterized by motivation and education, the second by meal planning, the third \nby a self- directed examination of interpersonal problems and the fourth by relapse prevention \nand work o n termination. \n \n \nPHARMA CO TH ERAPY \n \nConsider in g CBT as the treatment of choice, it is unfortunate that CBT availability may \nbe limited in the community. In a study by Crow and colleagues, (1) in a population of 353 \nwomen who were seeking treatment for BN, 65.4% had received previous treatment and of \nthese, 96. 7% reported receiving psychotherapy; however, only 6.9% of those reporting having \nreceived p sychotherapy reported that the therapy included basic elements of CBT. With this in mind ph armacotherapy has been investigated for over twenty years (30). \n EBSCOhost : eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:24:40 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Responses to antidepressant medication in BN are not \ndependent up on the existence of a pretreatment depression (32). In a study o f BN patients the \neffect of fl uoxetine 60 mg/day was found to not correlate with the baseline Hamilton \nDepression R ating Scale (HAM-D) score or comorbid depression diagnosis (33). \n \n \nRESPONSE V ER SUS REMISSION \n \nDespite mu lt iple studies showing greater efficacy than placebo (34-36) questions remain \nas to the ex tent of antidepressant treatment efficacy. Several tria ls have not been able to \ndifferentiat e active drug from placebo on important outcome variables (37,38). Also, despit e \nimpressive r eductions in the frequency of target symptoms, the percentage of subjects free of \nsymptoms (ab stinent) at the end of treatment is also disappointingly low. \nThe mean abs tinence rate associated with pharmacotherapy has been reported to be 24 % \n(39). In one seque ntial treatment controlled trial (40) those who did not achieve a 75% \nreduction in binge eating frequency with desipramine over 8 weeks were switched to \nfluoxetine. Pharmacologi cal treatment occurred in combination with CBT, supportive \npsychotherap y or alone. Overall, 74% of eligible patients required the switch to the second \npharmacologi cal treatment. Cessation of binge eating behavior was then found in 29% of the \nmedication o nly subjects by the end of the second treatment period. Studies of t he \ncombination of pharmacotherapy and CBT reported average remission rates of 42 to 49% \nversus avera ge rates of 23 to 36% with any single therapy (24). However, res ponse rates to \nsubsequent t herapies for patients who fail initial treatment have been variable. In one study , \nnon-responde rs to CBT or IPT were given fluoxetine or placebo. The active d rug was \nsuperior to placebo in improving symptoms (41). In another s tudy of patients in whom CBT \nhad not resu lted in remission, the rate of response to subsequent IPT was 16%, and the rate of \nresponse to pharmacotherapy (fluoxetine followed by desipramine if indicated) was only \n10% (36). \nM aintenance studies utilizing pharmacological agents have demonstrated efficacy over \nplacebo (42, 43). However thes e studies have been characterized by high drop-out rates, \nwhich make t hem difficult to interpret.

The total numb er of patients who relapsed did \nnot differ bet ween groups, although fluoxetine did prolong the time to relapse. Thus, the \nwei ght of the evidence suggests that single agent pharmacological treatment does not provide \na robust maint enance therapy for BN and patients achieving response but not remission \nappear to bene fit little from maintenance treatment. \nThere is a str ong need to develop new and better pharmacological approaches for these \npatients. Unfo rtunately there are no studies to date on the use of medication combinations or \naugmentation o f pharmacological treatments, strategies that have been used with success in \nseveral other pharmacotherapy areas including the treatment of depression and anxiety \ndisorders. \nTh e concept of treating to remission has been developed as a focus in the treatment of \naffective diso rders. It has been de monstrated that achieving remission (Hamilton Depression \nRating Scale s core < 8) versus only response (Hamilton Depression scale reduction of 50 %) \nis associated with better functioning (45) and prognosis (46,47). Unfortunately, studies which \nprovide data o n the outcome of patients who achieve abstinence in BN are few. In general, \na bstinence per sisting at one year of follow up is quite variable (48) and in light of this, no \nconsistent pre dictors of outcome have been identified (24). Thus an explor ation of techniques \nto enhance sym ptom reduction is needed. Sequencing med ication after failure to respond to \nCBT has shown mixed evidence. Medication add ition was found helpful in a pilot trial by \nWalsh and coll eagues (41). However a subs equent trial by Mitchell, et al. (40) found that after \nfailure of CBT those who were randomized to medication derived little benefit. Yet \ncombinati ons o f medicine are often prescribed in clinical practice without evidence regarding \nefficacy or to lerability (49). \n \n \nONDANSETRO N Non-antidepr es sants have also been demonstrated to have efficacy in the treatment of \nthose with BN. The serotonin 3 receptor (5-HT3) antagonist, ondansetron, was found to be \nefficacious in a randomized, double-blind trial (50). This agent is an antiemetic active at the \nvagus nerve te rminals peripherally and at the chemoreceptor trigger zone centrally (51). \nOndansetron is used extensively in chemo- and radiation- therapy induced nausea and \nvomiting. It i s suggeste d that BN patients have satiety defects caused by post-binge eating \nvagal stimulat ion. In a four week randomized, double blind trial patients receiving \nondansetron 24 mg/day reduced binge-vomit frequency from 12.8 ± 5.0/week to 6.5 ± \n3.9/week, an e stimated reduction of 6.8 episodes/week (p < 0.0001) while the placebo group \nreduced their mean binge-vomit frequency from 13.4 ± 9.9 to 13.2 ± 11.6 episodes per week. \n \n \nTOPIRAMATE Topiramate, an anticonvulsant associated with weight loss, has been explored for BN \ntreatment.

There have been two randomized controlled \ntrials of topira mate for BN treatment published (53,54). In addition, a r ecent review article \nsummarizes the e fficacy and tolerability of topiramate in the treatment of BN and binge \neating disorder (55). The controlled t rials in BN (53, 54) were both ten-weeks in duration and \ndemonstrated red uctions in binge/purge frequency as well as body weight with topiramate \nrelative to plac ebo. Hoopes and colle agues (53) demonstrated that at a median topiramate \ndose of 100 mg/d ay (range 25-400 mg/day), binge and/or purge days were significantly \nreduced (44.8%) relative to the reduction observed with placebo (10.7%). Body weight also differed signifi cantly between groups; with a 1.8 kg mean weight loss in the topiramate group \ncompared with a 0.2 kg increase in the placebo group. Similarly, Nicke l and colleagues (54) \nfound that binge /purge frequency decreased by 3.3 episodes per week with topiramate \n(titrated to 250 mg/day) relative to placebo. The topiramate g roup in this study experienced \nsignificantly mo re weight loss (4 kg) compared to the placebo group (0.3 kg). Treatment-\nemerg ent adverse effects in the study by Hoopes and colleagues were reported more \nfrequently with topiramate versus placebo. Effects reported by at least 10% of patients, \nincluded the fol lowing: fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, nausea, \nconstipation, di fficulty with concentration or attention, and nervousness. Study attrition due \nto adverse event s was low, however, including only one of 34 patients in the topiramate group \nwho experienced nausea. The study by Nic kel and colleagues (54) reported headache as the \nonly adverse eff ect which occurred more frequently with topiramate than with placebo, but \nthe dosage used was not stipulated. \n \n \nMISCELLANEOU S ME DICATIONS \n \n Other treatme nt s that have been studied include the androgen-antagonist flutamide, \nspironolactone, d-fenfluramine (no longer marketed), lithium, phenytoin and naltrexone, but \nnone have eviden ced clear efficacy, and none are commonly clinically employed in the \ntreatment of tho se with BN at this time (56,57). \n \n \nFUTURE PHARM AC OT HERAPY RESEARCH \n \nThe first phas e of investigation of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of BN has been \ncompleted. A var iety of dru gs have demonstrated benefit over placebo. However, the \nou tcome for BN p atients at this time is not optimal. It is time to em bark on the second phase \nof pharmacothera py investigation with BN. A next step in t his search is exploring the \naugmentation of primary pharmacotherapy with secondary agents. Investigations t o explore \nthe efficacy of selected secondary agents can determine if symptom reduction is achievable \nafter partial ef ficacy has been seen with the primary agent.

Established forms of psychotherapy include \ncognitive behavior al therapy, which has been the form most intensively studied, dialectical \nbehavioral therapy , interpersonal therapy and, two recently introduced approaches, enhanced \ncognitive behavior al therapy and integrative cognitive-affective therapy. Pharmacotherapy \na pproaches have re lied primarily on the use of antidepressant drugs, particularly the serotonin \nreuptake inhibitor s. The only FDA appro ved drug for the treatment of bulimia nervosa \nremains fluoxetine hydrochloride although a number of other agents are also effective. \nOndansetron and to piramate have also been studied in placebo-controlled trials. \n \n \nREFERENCES [1 ] Crow S, Muss el l MP, Peterson C, Knopke A, Mitchell J.

Indeed the most recent refinement has been a ‘transdiagnostic’ CBT for all eating disorders. This chapter discusses the most well tested and manualised CBTs for eating disorders, their theoretical basis, evidence and principles of treatment. Specific issues for the overweight patient are also discussed and further reading recommended. Keywords: psycho-education, monitoring, behavioural experiments, schema therapy, relapse prevention Introduction Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) combines behavioural experiments with rational disputation of patients’ beliefs. The former experiments act to help patients disconfirm their original assumptions and confirm alternative attitudes.

At the same time \nGa rner and Bemis (2) also developed a longer term (1-2 years) CBT for anorexia nervosa \n(A N). Bo th have undergone refinement but CBT-BN has two attributes which place it at the \nle ading edge of psychological therapies in eating disorders (EDs), namely it has evolved into \na ‘transdiagnostic’ ED therapy, and it has been tested comprehensively in randomised \nco ntrolled trials (3). Fo r this reason this chapter will first discuss CBT-BN and next CBT for \nAN . CB T for Bulimia Nervosa (CBT-BN) CB T for BN developed out of a theoretical understanding of the origin of disordered \nea ting and weight and shape concern based on a cycle of binge-eating followed by extreme \ndi eting and/or weight-control behaviours which exacerbate extreme weight concern and \nre inforce in its turn the ED behaviours.

The capacity for insight into the way early life experiences or their social and \ninte rpersonal context may have contributed to the onset of an ED is also often helpful in \nther apy. \nThe second phase of therapy starts with the behavioural monitoring and recording of \neati ng and weight control behaviours. Pati ents often find keeping this distressing and need to \nbe r eassured of its core role in therapy. Form s are standardised but can be adapted into journal \nform at and can be downloaded from the former website (see above). Reco rds are reviewed at \neach session. The next step is instituting a meal plan of regular eating e.g. three meals and \ntwo snacks per day combined with dietary education. It i s essential to avoid long periods \nwith out eating as this exacerbates the diet-binge cycle. The mid-phase of therapy focuses on \ncogn itive strategies such as Socratic questioning and challenging of beliefs and attitudes \nwhic h reinforce ED behaviours, such as valuing oneself according to one’s weight and shape \nand “all or nothing” dichotomous thinking.

By t he end of therapy, the goal of a \nregu lar pattern of eating of varied and normal-sized food portions should be achieved.

A full account and \ncompre hensive treatment manual is found in the text by Fairburn (4). \nThe ef ficacy of CBT-E has been tested in a 2-site 20-week treatment and 60 weeks closed \nfollow -up RCT with 154 normal weight ED patients (38% with BN) where it was found to \noffer advantages for those with more complex additional psychopathologies who appeared to \nbenefi t from the additional modules. For th ose without such problems however there were no \ndiffer ences in outcomes (15). Result s for the underweight patient have not yet been reported \n(see b elow). \nIn the additional mood intolerance module, it is recognised that there are several ways \nmood a nd eating may relate. For ex ample, people with anorexia may eat less to gain a sense \nof con trol over external events, or to demonstrate distress, defiance or anger. Emotio nal \noverea ting is often found in those who are overweight and binge eating with or without \nvomiti ng or compulsive exercise may occur to cope with negative moods or adverse events. \nEducat ion about the relationship(s) between moods and eating is provided, and explored with \nthe pa tient. Proble m solving and alternate mood modulation strategies are introduced and \npracti ced via behavioural experiments that are encouraged, monitored and reviewed. \nSelf-e steem is addressed through exploring and challenging the cognitive schemas that \npromot e core beliefs e.g. selective attention to information that supports a negative view of \nself-w orth. Encour aging new activities and friendships and working on interpersonal \nrelati onships is also helpful. The sp ecific interpersonal module closely follows that developed \nby Fai rburn and colleagues as a stand alone control therapy for CBT-BN (16). Clinic al \nperfec tionism and the need to attain this through the ED is explored in a formulation that \nmirror s that of the role of over-concern about weight and shape on promoting ED behaviours. \nPerfec tionism in ED is regarded as ‘clinical’ when it is so extreme that patients can never be \nsatisf ied with an achievement and any error is intolerable. In the rapy mistakes can be \n‘refra med’ as ‘inevitable’ because ‘no-one can be perfect - to err is human’, and mistakes are \nimport ant and necessary to provide opportunity for new learning. \n \n \nCB T fo r anorexia nervosa (CBT-AN) \n \nThe ce ntral goal of CBT in AN is the normalization of eating behaviour to ensure \nconsis tent weight gain and medical stability to achieve a healthy weight with specific focus \non the interaction between the thoughts, emotions and behaviours that are the core \npsycho pathology of AN. Garner , Vitousek, and Pike (1997 page 109(17)) postulated the \nfollow ing principles of CBT in AN: \n(i) th e acceptance of conscious experience rather than unconscious phenomena. \n(ii) f ocus upon belief, assumptions, schematic processing and meaning systems as \nmediat ing variables for maladaptive behaviours and emotions. \n(iii) the employment of questioning as a prominent therapeutic strategy. \n(iv) a ctive participation by the therapist in treatment \n(v) th e essential contribution of homework sessions including self-monitoring \n EBSCO host: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:26:00 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

This man ualised CBT-AN follows three clearly defined \nphases o f treatment: \nPhase I: Building trust and setting treatment parameters. Here the principal goals are to build \na positi ve therapeutic alliance, exploring and identifying the key features of the ED, providing \neducatio n about starvation symptoms and other related topics, giving a rationale and advice \nfor rest oring normal nutrition and body weight, and prescribing eating patterns and \nestablis hing a regular eating pattern. Dietary restriction is addressed and patients are advised \nto eat r egular meals at regular times and gradually increase portion sizes. Psycho-e ducation \nabout st arvation and effects of AN is also important at his stage. (An exce llent source is found \nin Garne r (19)). This pha se emphasises the need for the patient to move into an ‘action’ stage \nof chang e and motivational enhancement therapeutic strategies such as decisional analyses \nare util ised to help achieve this. This is crucial as outcomes are poorer where there is poor \nmotivati on to change and the majority of patients with AN who come for therapy are at a pre-\ncontempl ative or contemplative stage of change. \nPhase II : Changing beliefs related to food and weight, then broadening the scope of therapy. \nThe goal s here are to continue the emphasis on weight gain and normalising eating and to \nbring th ese about by reframing relapse, identifying dysfunctional thoughts, exploring negative \nschema a nd thinking patterns, developing cognitive restructuring skills, modifying self-\nconcept, and (like CBT-E above) developing an interpersonal focus in therapy. \nPhase II I: Preventing relapse and preparing for termination. Here the therapist clarifies the \nchanges the patient has made, and prepares the patient for residual problems that may be \nfound on ce therapy has concluded. \nIt must be emphasised that CBT-AN is also most appropriately and safely delivered \nwithin a multi-disciplinary context. This is where a physician will provide advice and monitor \nmedical status (20) and if possible a dietician will provide expert and individualised \nnutritio nal advice. \nThere is small but mixed evidence base for CBT-AN in AN. Channon and colleagues \n(21) in a non-blinded RCT compared CBT to behaviour therapy alone and to a control \n\"eclecti c\" therapy in 24 of 34 outpatients. Outcomes for participants in all treatment groups \ndid not differ but improvements were modest. Serfaty and colleagues (22) compared a form \nof CBT o ver 20 weekly sessions with dietary advice in 35 patients followed to 6 months and \nno patie nts in the dietary advice group completed therapy.

Finally, Pike and colleagues (24) found in 33 patients that \nCBT-AN h ad a better outcome and longer time to relapse when compared to nutritional \ncounsell ing therapy following hospital care and weight gain restoration. \nThe tran sdiagnostic CBT (CBT-E) developed by Fairburn and colleagues (4) is extended \nfrom CBT -BN (see above) but incorporates a module on therapy in the underweight \n EBSCOho st: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:26:00 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

This has m any features similar to the CBT-AN of Pike and \ncolleagues (18) but the focus is more on behavioural change (and monitoring of behaviours \nthat reinf orce the ED psychopathology such as body checking) and motivational enhancement \nstrategies (excepting a decisional analysis) are not emphasised. Both thera pies have \nmonitoring weight as essential. CBT-E is m ore prescriptive of calorie needs, use of energy \ndense drin ks to help achieve this, and a goal to ‘maintenance’ BMI of 19-20 with a weight \ngain of ap proximately 500 grams per week for outpatients. CBT-E reco mmends involving \ncaregivers so that they help support the patient with all matters regarding food and eating in \nboth psych ological and pragmatic ways e.g. cooking with the patient. Randomised trials of \nCBT-E have been conducted but are yet to be published. \n \n \nCBT in o ve rweight patients \n \nCBT for ov erweight patients was first described by Cooper & Fairburn in 2000 (25), with \na program that is focussed on reducing weight loss to 5-10% and preventing weight regain or \nmaintainin g weight loss at the end of program. The style resembles CBT-BN. The treatm ent \nstructure includes 24 sessions over an 11 month period, on a one-to-one basis. The progra m is \nbased on t wo phases and nine modules, allowing the treatment to be tailored to the individual. \nThe first and second phases are similar to CBT-BN, with the third phase focussing on weight \nmaintenanc e and prevention of weight gain. However, i n a longer term follow-up (26) of a \nrandomised controlled trial comparing the CBT to guided self-help results were \ndisappoint ing. In this tr ial at 3-years there were no differences between groups and most \nweight los t was regained by participants. \nPatients w ho are overweight or obese and have an ED, such as binge eating disorder will \nbenefit as well from CBT-E (4) as described above. In additio n they may also need a \nsupported weight loss program, particularly those patients with weight related medical \nproblems s uch as diabetes or high blood pressure. In many ca ses, even a small weight loss \nsuch as th e loss of 5-10% body weight, could reduce the risk of developing diabetes and/or \ncardiovasc ular diseases (27, 28).

Classically CBT in eating disorders will have an \ninitial psyc ho-education and motivational phase which is followed by normalisation of eating \nwith behavio ural experiments and strategies to address body image and other typical \ncognitive sc hema. Therapy clos es with preparation for termination and relapse prevention \ntechniques. CBT may ofte n be supplemented with other approaches including emotion \nregulation s kills training, strategies to improve self-esteem and reduce extreme perfectionism \nand interper sonal therapy. All these ar e features of the extended to a transdiagnostic CBT-E \n(4). \nThe ev idence base is strongest for specific CBT-BN and its next generation CBT-E (1,4). \nLong-term (5 -year) maintenance of change has also been reported for CBT-BN (31) and it is \ngenerally re garded as ‘first-line’ treatment for BN. Evidence is present but weaker for CBT-\nAN and CBT u sed in other eating disorders. CBT has been developed for obesity but long \nterm mainten ance of weight loss has not been found. Further rese arch is needed to establish \nthe efficacy compared to other psychotherapies of CBT-AN and CBT-E in underweight \npatients. Suggeste d Re ading \n \nTouyz S, P ol ivy J, Hay P.

Abstract Family-based treatment (FBT) is emerging as a treatment of choice for adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). This paper reviews the history of FBT, core clinical and theoretical elements, and key findings from the FBT for AN and BN treatment outcome literature. In addition, we address clinical questions and controversies regarding FBT for eating disorders, including whether FBT is clinically appropriate for all adolescents (e.g., older adolescents, patients with comorbid conditions), and whether it indicated for all types of families (e.g., critical, enmeshed, and non-intact families). Finally, we outline recently manualized, innovative applications of FBT for new populations currently under early investigation, such as FBT as a preventive/early intervention for AN, FBT for young adults with eating disorders, and FBT for pediatric overweight. Keywords: family-based treatment, eating disorders, adolescents.

Th is team was based at the Institute of Psychiatry and the Maudsley Hospital in \nLo ndon, England. Co nsequently, this treatment has come to be known as the \"Maudsley \nAp proach\" or the \"Maudsley Method\" (1). \nFB T is a novel therapy in that it is theoretically agnostic and emphasizes parents as a \nre source, and empowers families in their effort to bring about recovery in their adolescent \nwi th an eating disorder. Ho wever, the first effort to include families in the treatment of \nad olescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) was made by Minuchin and his colleagues at the \nCh ild Guidance Clinic in Philadelphia (2). Wh ile treatment was quite mixed, the primary \nin tervention was family therapy and the authors reported successful outcome in about 86% of \npa tients. Gi ven this success rate, as well as the theoretical model of the \"psychosomatic \nfa mily\" upon which much of their work was based, Minuchin's work ultimately exerted \nco nsiderable influence on ensuing efforts by the Maudsley group to involve families in the \ntr eatment of adolescents with AN. \nTh e underlying theoretical principles and clinical application of Minuchin's structural \nfa mily therapy, along with other school's of thought such as Palazzoli's (3) work from the \nMi lan Group and Haley's (4) strategic therapy, served as the foundation for the development \nof FBT.

Th is, in turn, gave rise to a number of controlled FBT studies which were pioneered \nat the Maudsley Hospital in London. FB T, as employed in these studies, contained several \nas pects of Minuchin's approach, but differed in significant ways. \nMo st important of these was that the Maudsley team, unlike Minuchin, encouraged \npa rents to persist in their efforts until normal body weight had been achieved. In FBT, general \nad olescent and family issues are deferred until the eating disorder behavior was under control. \nFB T remained limited to England from the time of its development until the mid 1990s. \nIn 1994, Daniel le Grange, a member of the Maudsley team introduced FBT to his colleagues \nin the United States, when he trained at Stanford University. Th rough the relationships he \nes tablished at Stanford University, he teamed up with James Lock to collaborate on \nma nualizing (5) and studying this approach in clinical research trials targeting adolescents \nwi th eating disorders. \nMu ch of their work, both collaboratively and independently, has led to the successful \ndi ssemination of FBT to other specialist centers in the United States, Canada and Australia. TH E FOUNDATION APPROACH Co re Clinical and Theoretical Elements \nFB T for adolescent AN is the original application of this model and its protocol (5) \nre presents the foundation approach. In addition, manualized adaptations exist for bulimia \nne rvosa (BN) (6), for the prevention of AN in children and adolescents with clinically \nsi gnificant, prodromal presentations (7), for young adults with AN (8), and for pediatric \nov erweight (9). Th ese newer applications will be described in detail below. FB T for \nad olescent AN is a short-term treatment designed to mobilize parents in assisting their ill \nch ild reverse his/her state of starvation acutely and ultimately achieve remission from AN. \nGi ven the profound physical and psychosocial liabilities associated with AN, a primary goal \nof FBT is to facilitate a return to a normal developmental trajectory, consistent with \n E BSCOhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:25:40 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

FBT challenges the practical factors maintaining the AN, such as allowing \nthe ill adolescent to make his/her own food choices, and makes no assumptions about the \ncaus e of AN. The treatment does not presuppose a familial pathology and in fact works to \nredu ce parental self-blame regarding etiology. More over, FBT externalizes the illness, \nther eby reducing blame toward the ill adolescent for the symptoms s/he is experiencing. This aids in correcting misperceptions often held by siblings, who may believe their sister/brother \nis o rchestrating the AN for attention.

Sibl ing relationships are further protected by assigning a \nsupp ortive role in treatment to siblings, reserving all supervisory responsibilities exclusively \nfor the parents (10). \nIn t he first of three phases of treatment, parents fully take charge of their ill child's eating, \nassu ming the functions typical of an inpatient staff. The therapist helps parents develop and \nrefi ne their techniques in an in-session family meal, a goal of which is for parents to convince \nthei r child to consume at least one more bite than s/he was originally willing. It i s important \nto e mphasize that this parental stance is unique to Phase I of FBT; once a minimal level of \nweig ht restoration is achieved (i.e., the adolescent crosses back over the diagnostic weight \nthre shold) and conflict around eating is significantly reduced, control over food consumption \nis t ransferred back to the adolescent in Phase II of treatment. Phas e III of FBT focuses on \nterm ination and more general issues of adolescent development. In i ts manualized format (5), \nFBT encompasses 20 sessions, although recent research indicates that a shorter course is as \neffi cacious and arguably more cost-effective (11). \nAs s uggested above, FBT incorporates an amalgam of techniques from family systems \nther apy, structural family therapy, and eating disorders- specific interventions. Also , as the \ntrea tment does not align with a particular therapeutic approach, etiological theory of AN, or \nmode l regarding maintenance of illness, hypothesized mechanisms of action of FBT for AN \nincl ude exposure to forbidden foods and feared weight ranges, restructuring of family \nauth orities and coalitions, and hormonal re- regulation as a function of weight restoration. \nFBT for AN has not been directly compared to inpatient behavioral interventions; however, \nlong -term data across clinical trials and naturalistic follow-up studies indicate that treatment \neffe cts are more durable and relapse rates are markedly lower in FBT (12-14). Sinc e FBT \ndoes not directly target the psychological feature of AN, such as fear of weight gain and body \nimag e disturbance, it is unlikely that improvements in these domains account for the sustained \ngood outcome several years after completing FBT (12-14). Howe ver, indirect effects in these \nsymp toms via the mechanisms noted above (e.g., exposure to feared weights, hormonal \ncorr ection following full and sustained weight restoration) cannot be ruled out. Anot her \nposs ibility is that since FBT for adolescent AN by definition targets younger patients with a \nmore recent onset of illness than their adult counterparts, this population is more responsive \nto t reatment and has a better prognosis. Howe ver, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of \nFBT versus individual psychotherapy show that even within this restricted age range, FBT is \nsupe rior (12,15-17). Fina lly, it is likely that by training parents to create a zero- tolerance \nenvi ronment for self-starvation in their home and teaching them to identify signs and \nsymp toms of AN, they keep relapse at bay. In t hat respect, parents can prevent a kindling \neffe ct, with each relapse increasing the likelihood of a subsequent one and of a more chronic \ncour se of illness.

The fi rst RCT \nof FBT for AN included a population of adolescent and adult patients. The on ly significant \nfindin g from this study demonstrated that FBT was particularly efficacious for patients 18 and \nyounge r. That i s, FBT delivered better results in absolute clinical outcome and relative to \nindivi dual treatment, acutely (one-year post- hospitalization) (17) and at five-year follow-up \n(12). These seminal studies provided preliminary evidence of FBT's utility in preventing \nrelaps e and facilitating continued improvement following inpatient weight restoration. \nSince then, FBT for adolescents with AN has been subjected to further study in several \nadditi onal RCTs, open trials, and clinical case series. Taken together, this literature has \ndemons trated that FBT is effective for a full course of outpatient weight restoration thereby \npreven ting hospitalization (11,18,19) and that such gains are maintained 4-5 years after \ntreatm ent ends (12-14); a version of FBT in which parents are seen separately from their \nadoles cent is superior to the traditional conjoint FBT format when families are critical of their \nadoles cent (high levels of expressed emotion) (18,21); that FBT yields a better outcome than \neither supportive individual psychotherapy (17) or a more focused and manualized ego-\norient ed individual therapy (15,16); that an abbreviated, 10-session course of FBT is as \neffica cious as the manualized 20-session version (11); that FBT can be disseminated in that it \nis fea sible and effective when administered by investigators other than its developers (22,23); \nand th at it appears to be as effective for children as it is for adolescents (24). \n \n \nFB T FO R ADOLESCENT BULIMIA NERVOSA \n \nRati on ale for Adaptation \nFamily -Based Treatment for bulimia nervosa (FBT-BN) (6) has been adapted from FBT \nfor AN and, like its predecessor, is designed for adolescents. Until the development of this \nmanual , only a limited number of either case series or case studies have been conducted for \nadoles cents with BN. Most o f these studies involve the patient's parents in the treatment. \nMoreov er, AN - binge/purge subtype (about 20% of the samples studied) is typically \nrespon sive to FBT in terms of weight gain and reductions in binge and purge episodes. This sugges ts that parents are able to effectively decrease bulimic behaviors in addition to \nrevers ing severe dieting (11,18). Wherea s AN and BN are distinct syndromes, considerable \noverla p in symptomatology is common Therefore, the efficacy of FBT for adolescent AN \nmight be extended to include adolescent BN. \nAs in FBT for AN, this treatment modality for adolescents with BN is an outpatient \ninterv ention typically conducted in 20 sessions over 6 months. In som e instances a shorter \ncourse is sufficient while additional sessions may be necessary for others. FBTBN consists of \nthree phases. In Pha se I parents are encouraged to assist their teen to reestablish healthy \neating patterns and avoid engaging in binge eating and purging episodes.

In Phase II manages the return of control over eating to the \nadolesce nt at the time that acute symptoms have abated and regular eating patterns are \nestablis hed. Phase II I addresses termination and issues of family structure and normal \nadolesce nt development. \nIn keepi ng with FBT for AN, FBT-BN also views the parents as a resource for resolving \nthe eati ng disorder, and corrects misperceptions of blame directed to either the parents and \ntheir ad olescent. Siblings are protected from the job assigned to the parents and are \nencourag ed to play a supportive role in treatment. FBT-BN d oes not delve into what caused \nBN, inst ead, this treatment focuses on what can be done to resolve this serious disorder. \n \nKey Fi nd ings from the Literature \nThe firs t of only two RCTs for adolescents with BN compared family therapy (n=41) (a \nform of FBTBN) and cognitive-behavioral guided self-care (n=44) (CBT-GSC) (25). These \na uthors found no statistical differences at six months follow-up between the two treatments \non binge /purge abstinence rates (around 40% for both). Direct c ost was lower for CBT-GSC \ncompared to family therapy, however, there were no other differences in cost between these \ntwo trea tments. In the s econd RCT, Le Grange and colleagues (26) assigned 41 patients to \nFBT-BN a nd 39 to supportive psychotherapy (SPT), and unlike the Schmidt et al. (25), \ns ignific ant differences between the treatments did emerge. Categori cal outcomes at post-\ntreatmen t demonstrated significantly more patients in FBT-BN (39%) were binge/purge \nabstinen t compared to SPT (17.9%). Somewhat fewer patients were abstinent at 6-month \nfollow-u p, however, the difference was statistically in favor of FBT-BN (29.3% vs 10.3%). \nSecondar y outcome assessment, based upon random regression analysis, revealed main \neffects in favor of FBT-BN on all measures of eating pathology. Therefor e, FBT-BN showed \na clinic al and statistical advantage over IPT at post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. \nReductio n in core bulimic symptoms was also more acute for patients in FBTBN as opposed \nto SPT. But stil l it is the same results, when comparing FBT-BN to CBT-GSC. That is, FBT-\nBN and C BT-GSC are significantly favored treatments in comparison to SPT. \n \n \nCLIN IC AL QUESTIONS AND CONTROVERSIES \n \nDoes F BT Work for All Adolescents with AN or BN? \nIs FBT c linically appropriate across the child- adolescent age spectrum?

In AN, thi s initial phase of treatment is characterized by parents \nassuming f ull responsibility for their child's eating; in BN, where the adolescent is typically \nless impai red and more on a par with her peers in terms of adolescent development, the \nprocess in Phase I is more collaborative between parents and child. \nGiven the equalizing force of the eating disorder in yielding a similarly regressed state \nacross chr onological age, FBT does not modulate its early techniques as a function of \nadolescent stage of development. However, P hase II, in which control is transferred back to \nthe adoles cent, and Phase III, in which broader issues of adolescence are addressed, are \nexquisitel y sensitive to the subtle and gross differences between early, middle, and late \nadolescenc e. Importantl y, even in Phase I, the therapist instructs the family to defer to actual \nstage of a dolescent development in domains external to the eating disorder. For exampl e, \nwhile pare nts may fully supervise meals, they would not supervise their adolescent's social \nencounters in the same manner. If parents do not afford sufficient respect to adolescent \ndevelopmen t in these other areas — whether pre- morbidly, as a function of general concern \nfor their ill child, or based on a misunderstanding of their mission in FBT — the therapist \nactively c orrects this. \nDoes the r esearch support the application of FBT across the full child-adolescent age \nspectrum? While not yet tested in an RCT, FBT for children has generated promising results \nin a clini cal case series (24) Within adolescence, compared to younger adolescents with AN, \nthe eviden ce for the efficacy of FBT for older adolescents is somewhat mixed. A case ser ies \nof adolesc ents with AN (22) showed no difference in outcome for younger (9-14 years) \nversus old er (15-18 years) patients. Recent FBT trials for adolescent AN (12 to 18 years) (11) \nor BN (12 to 19 years old) (26) found that age was not a moderator of treatment outcome. In \ncontra st, younger age was a predictor of remission for AN in univariate (but not multivariate) \nanalyses ( 20). However, i t is difficult to disentangle age from other variables that might be a \nproxy for severity of illness, such duration of illness, number of previous hospitalizations, and \nBMI, all o f which loaded with age on the principal component analysis in that study (20). \nIs FBT cli nically appropriate for adolescents with greater levels of specific and comorbid \npsychopath ology?

In the onl y predictor \nanalysis f or adolescents with BN receiving FBT or SPT, findings indicated that participants \nwith less severe Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) (27) eating concerns at baseline were \nmore likel y to be binge and purge abstinent (remitted) at post-treatment and follow-up, \nregardless of the treatment that they received (28).

Expressed Em otion (EE) has been studied in the families of patients \nwith eating disorders (21,30-35), and has become a useful way to tap into the quality of the \n'emotional l ife' of families of children with eating disorders. For instance , Minuchin and his \ncolleagues ( 2,36) suggested that families of children with AN have several characteristics in \ncommon, such as enmeshment, and lack of conflict resolution. EE allows us to reliably \nmeasure seve ral aspects of functioning in families with an eating disorder offspring. \nStudies have shown that patients with AN are more likely to drop out of treatment \nprematurely, or have a poor outcome should they remain in treatment, if their parents are \noverly criti cal toward them (high EE family) (21,33,34). This fmding has recently also been \nreplicated f or adolescents with BN (31). Family inter action has important treatment \nimplications . For instance , a version of FBT for AN in which parents are seen separately from \ntheir adoles cent has shown to be superior to FBT in its conjoint format when families present \nwith high le vels of EE (high in terms of criticism) (18,21). This line of inquiry is still in its \ninfancy and more work is clearly required. \nEnmeshed Fam ilies.

A traditiona l theory of eating disorders in adolescence, particularly \nAN, is that the illness represents a maladaptive attempt at separation and control in the \ncontext of a n enmeshed family (36). Correspondin gly, a prescription for recovery is often to \nafford more autonomy to the adolescent, especially with regard to eating, so as to prevent an \nexacerbation of symptoms. At its extre me, this recommendation excludes parents from \ntreatment en tirely, and has been labeled a \"parentectomy\" (37). In turn, a c riticism that has \nbeen raised against FBT is that it prescribes, rather than proscribes enmeshment by virtue of \nPhase I tech niques. This concern is predicated on four assumptions: first, that family \nenmeshment i s implicated in the etiology of adolescent eating disorders; second, that FBT \ndoes not res pect adolescent autonomy; third, that enmeshed parents would resist the transfer \nof control b ack to the adolescent in Phase II; and fourth, that FBT should ultimately worsen \nsymptoms, ev en if it suppresses them in the short term. Each assumpt ion is contradicted by or \nlacks suppor t in research fmdings. \nFirst, there are no longitudinal data to indicate enmeshment plays an etiological role in \neating disor ders. Even if larg e cross-sectional studies were to find an increased prevalence of \nenmeshment i n eating disorder families relative to psychiatric and normal controls, it would \nbe difficult to know whether this reflected cause of illness or the effect of having a child with \na severe dis order, particularly one associated with a high mortality rate. Second, as n oted \nabove, FBT a ffords significant respect to adolescent autonomy, by maintaining domain \nspecificity of parental control in Phase I, requiring transfer of control over food in Phase II, \nand directly addressing adolescent development, including issues pertaining to separation and \nindividuatio n, in Phase III. In this resp ect, FBT can theoretically correct the expressions of an \nenmeshed fam ily dynamic (while not directly treating the underlying family pathology) and \nwould not be contraindicated for such a family. Third, there is no evidence to suggest that \nparents resi st the transition to Phase II, which would be indicative of an enmeshed family \nprocess; in fact, clinical observations suggest a greater risk is parents' abrupt or rapid \nabdication o f supervisory responsibilities once weight is minimally restored.

Non-Intact Fam ilies. Another concer n that has been raised about FBT is whether it is \nappropriate fo r a variety of family structures (e.g., divorced, separated, single parent, \ngrandparent-he aded households, etc.) beyond the traditional intact family. The treatment manuals (5,6) have the latitude to accommodate atypical family configurations provided that \nat least one p arent or guardian can be involved in treatment. Moderator anal yses from the \nLock et al (11 ) comparison of 6-month versus 12-month FBT for AN showed that non-intact \nfamily status fared better with a longer treatment duration. Predictor anal yses (20) from this \nstudy did not fmd family status to predict dropout or remission. In the BN lite rature, FBT was \nequally effect ive for intact and non-intact families (28). Collectively, these findings support \nthe use of FBT with both intact and non-intact families, with the latter benefiting from a full, \n12-month (20- session) course of treatment, per the published manual (5). \n \n \nNEW APPLIC AT IO NS UNDER INVESTIGATION \n \nFBT for Youn g Adults with AN \nThe absence of FBT studies for young adults (1825 years) with AN is surprising for at \nleast two reas ons; there are similarities in terms of how fmancially dependent older \nadolescents an d young adults are upon their parents, and there are significant challenges to \nengage and mai ntain adults in treatment. Young adults l ike older adolescents are substantially \nfmancially dep endent on their parents, with nearly two-thirds of young adults in their early \n20s receiving economic support from their parents (38). US census data from 1970-2000 \nsuggest that t he percentage of young adults living without fmancial dependence on family has \ndeclined signi ficantly (39). Thus, dependen ce upon family resources continues later into the \n20's for more young adults today than it did even a decade or two ago. Thus, it is su rprising \nthat we have n ot systematically used family treatment with young adults especially given the \nnotorious diff iculty in engaging and maintaining adults with AN in treatment (29). Involving \nfam ily or othe r individuals who are concerned about the patient in treatment together with the \nAN patient may be a powerful way to maintain the patient's engagement. This is seen c learly \nin dropout rat es for adult AN with the largest study reporting a dropout rate of 46% (29) and \nFBT treatment with adolescent AN showing dropout rates of 10-20% (11,40). \nWhile young ad ults may still be substantially dependent upon parents, they also face \ndifferent chal lenges than adolescents. It must also b e noted that despite similarities, young \nadulthood has certain developmental differences from adolescence. For instance, young adults \nare legally re garded as adults, are more likely to be independent, and are more intellectually \nand socially e xperienced and skilled than adolescents. For instance, young adults are more \nlikely to have moved out from home than adolescents with about half of the 27 million 18 to \n24 years olds in the USA are not living with their parents (55.7%) (41). Due to this re lative \nindependence f rom family, young adults may struggle with new living situations, \nparticipation in the work-force or further educational challenges.

In other words, it is more in keeping with the model for BN \nas opposed to ad olescent AN. \n \nFBT for Subsyn dr omal Anorexia Nervosa in Children and Adolescents \nEarly identifica tion and treatment of AN is considered to have a positive prognostic \nimpact on the co urse of illness in AN (42,43), although duration of illness remains a potential \nconfound in thes e analyses (44). Given that (a) c hildren and adolescents often present \natypically on a number of dimensions relative to strict DSM (45) diagnostic criteria \n(Workgroup for C lassification of Eating Disorders in Children and Adolescents (WCEDCA)), \n(46), (b) clinic ally significant but technically subthreshold presentations of AN (SAN) can \nreflect a disord er in evolution rather than a stable state or transient phase (e.g., 47, 48, 49) and \n(c) once the dia gnostic threshold is crossed, AN is notoriously refractory to treatment, it is \nreasonable to ta rget SAN at the intersect of prevention and intervention for AN. FBT is an \nexcel lent candid ate preventive intervention for SAN in light of its efficacy for AN (50). In \naddition, an ope n feasibility/dissemination trial of FBT for AN- spectrum presentations found \nthat FBT arreste d and reversed AN symptoms in an SAN subset (23). An RCT is curren tly \nunderway at Moun t Sinai School of Medicine comparing FBT-SAN (7) to individual \nsupportive psych otherapy in this potentially prodromal population. \nWhile much of th e core FBT for AN protocol (5) applies to clinically significant SAN \npatients, severa l important modifications are noted. First, the found ation approach is modified \nto address a wid er range of developmental stages. While AN typical ly onsets in mid-late \nadolescence, pro dromal AN by defmition precedes this. Second, for SAN participants who \nhave lost weight but do not yet meet the weight cutoff for AN, regulation of eating patterns \nand the incorpor ation of a full range of foods in the child or adolescent's diet may be as \nimportant goals as weight gain early in treatment. Third, the goals and language of the \ntreatment re mod ified to incorporate the notion of risk of progression from SAN to AN, while \nat the same time emphasizing the clinical severity of the SAN in and of itself, and the need \nfor reduction an d resolution of presenting symptoms. While we cannot be certain that all such \npatients would e ventually go on to develop AN (i.e., that they are truly prodromal), their \nsymptoms are suf ficiently clinically severe to warrant intervention. Fourth, the revi sions for \nSAN stress the i mportance of regular family meals at home and the modeling of healthy, non-\nrestrictive eati ng habits by parents. \n \nFBT for Pediat ri c Overweight \nParent involveme nt is a crucial element in reducing pediatric overweight (PO) in light of \nparents' ability to control and modify the family's home environment to promote the child's \nhealthy behavior s.

To date, no PO \ntr eatment study ha s targeted overweight across the child-adolescent age spectrum, nor has \nattempted to modul ate parental involvement from a transdevelopmental perspective. FBT is a \nlogical foundation approach to begin to resolve these deficits in the literature. \nInherent in the FB T model is a mission to increase parental empowerment, competence, \nand efficacy in fa cilitating healthy behaviors and outcomes for children, and in \nunapologetically a ssuming appropriate parental influence. Beyond this, FBT p rovides a strong \nfoundation for app lication to the significant problem of PO because of its attention to parental \nengagement strateg ies, its demonstrated efficacy in correcting maladaptive eating and related \nbehaviors, its exp licit agenda of blame reduction, its disease-based model, and its emphasis \non promoting norma l physical and psychosocial development for the child or adolescent. \nLoeb and colleague s (9) proposed an innovative adaptation of FBT to PO (FBT-PO) that \nmaintains the unde rlying tenets of the original FBT protocol but modifies it for a non- \npsychiatric weight disorder, with application to either psychiatric or primary care settings. \nFBT-P0 is currentl y being piloted at two sites (Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the \nUniversity of Chic ago.) Importantly, FBT-P 0 recognizes that PO is not a psychiatric disorder \nand that children/ adolescents are not developmentally regressed as they are in severe eating \ndisorders. Therefo re, FBT-P0 modulates the quality and intensity of parental involvement as a \nfunction of develo pmental stage. It also recognizes specific challenges of socioeconomically \ndiverse population s (e.g., built environment, reduction in school-based physical activity), the \nchallenges of conc ordance of overweight across family members, and the need for parents to \nmodel attitudes an d dietary/physical activity habits associated with healthy weight. Finally, \nFBT-P0 a ddresses t he multi- systemic toxic environment (54) that contributes to PO, and \nfocuses on parent- driven, family-level change. \n \n \nCONCLUSION In c onclusion, F BT is emerging as a treatment of choice for adolescent anorexia nervosa \nand bulimia nervos a, with promising adaptations for prevention of eating disorders in high \nrisk children and adolescents, for young adult eating disorders, and for pediatric overweight. \nWhile the interven tion continues to raise questions and controversies, it is gaining public and \nscientific accepta","section":"p11"}

However, additiona l and \nlarger clinical tr ials are necessary to fully test its scientific merit. An NIMH five year two-site \nRCT (the Universit y of Chicago and Stanford University) commenced in April 2004. In this \nstudy, ad olescents with AN were randomly allocated to either FBT or Ego-oriented Individual \nTherapy (EOIT). Th is is the first large-scale treatment trial for adolescents with AN and \nshould, upon compl etion, go some way toward verifying the relative efficacy of FBT for this \nclinical populatio n. Another NIMH-funde d multi-site study (with Stanford University as the \nCoordinating Cente r and 6 clinical sites) is examining FBT relative to family systems therapy \nas well as the adj unctive role of medication. Other studies unde rway involving FBT principles \ninclude a parent t raining treatment development study at Duke University; a study \ninvestigating the role of FBT in inpatient care at the University of Sydney; and a study of \nmulti-family group FBT at the Institute of Psychiatry, London.

Larger trials for AN and \nBN, especially desig ns with two active treatments with hypothesized mediators, would permit \ninvestigation of mec hanisms of FBT. It is also important to examine the relative moderating \neffect of symptom se verity in terms of cognitions for a treatment that focuses on such \nsymptoms, e.g., CBT, in order to determine whether these moderating effects would be \nsimilar between two specific treatments. Finally, the newly m anualized and piloted \nadaptations of FBT d escribed above require formal testing, as well as raise intriguing \npossibilities about the adaptation of FBT to other psychiatric disorders in adolescence, such as \nsubstance abuse.

E nro ll patients and enhance patient’s motivations to treatment \nFirs t steps in the collaborative journey: \nFrom most patients’ point of view, nutrition counselling and getting rid of the eating \ndiso rders is an unacceptably perilous journey into appetites, desire, and passions, from which \nthey must retreat or risk calamity. Most patients enter treatment due to pressure from family \nor f riends. Thus , a confrontational approach, in which the patient is pressured to accept expert \nadvi ce and is compelled to change old habits, is recommended only in cases of an immediate \nthre at to one’s life. Howe ver, since patients tend to see their disorder as an accomplishment \nrath er than as an affliction, such an approach elicits patients’ resistance. \nThe first step for collaborative journey and engaging patients to actively take part in their \nown recovery can be performed using motivational interview (4) or narrative interview \ntech niques (5,6). Both approaches prefer the interview framework in which the therapist \nexpl ains and models a collaborative journey towards understanding, developing an obligated \nstan ce against the problem, and coping with the journey toward freedom. The therapist adopts \na cu rious, nonjudgmental stance, shows genuine interest in the client's experience, models \nabil ity to tolerate confusion, and seeks clarification as needed. \nA ce ntral notion in the narrative approach is based on Foucault’s epigram (7): 'The \npers on is not the problem, the problem is the problem', which can be made more sophisticated \nby s ubsequently noting that, once the problem and the person can be conceived of as \nsepa rable, the problem is neither the person nor the problem, but the person’s relationship \nwith the problem.

Fouc ault has suggested that individuals internalize oppressive ideas in \ncult ural, political, and social contexts. Thus , in narrative therapy clinical problems are \nconc eptualized as restraining narratives that are influenced by one’s culture and society (6). \nA se cond central notion in the narrative approach is the use of “externalizing \nconv ersations” to help clients develop hostility towards the problem. For a narrative therapist, \na pe rson does not have eating disorder, but rather the eating disorder has him. When people \ncan linguistically start to be disentangled from the problem and can discover that they, \nactu ally, might be otherwise than how “anorexia would have them believe themselves to be” \n(for example, “worthless”), perhaps other versions of themselves could be foundational to \neffo rts of resistance to, and refutation of, the newly-defined problem. \nA th ird notion in the narrative approach is the realization that the patient who is \nexpe riencing the problem is the expert. The change process involves helping clients replace \nthei r “dominant stories” with more empowering stories about their lives (8). \n \nTh e first meeting \nThis meeting is significant in conveying the “collaborative” nature of the intervention, in \nwhic h the treatment team, the patient, and family members are working together for one \ncomm on goal: to achieve freedom from the eating disorder's tyranny and gain freedom of \nchoi ces in life. At t he first meeting, the counselor might be curious about the impact of the \nprob lem on the various fields in a patient’s life.

Howeve r, \nalthou gh it is crucial to empower the patient's hopes, the nutritionist should avoid \noversi mplifying the ease of solving problems, encourage expression and sharing of fears, \nvalida ting the patient’s ambivalence and other feelings about having to cope with the disease \n(11). The ab ility to facilitate a commitment toward change is the key challenge of the \ntherap ist in the beginning phase of change. \n \nThe Th erapeutic Alliance \nThe th erapeutic relationship is a key function in the successful treatment of eating \ndisord ers. In gen eral, a \npatien t should feel as though he or she is a valid, significant part of \nthe th erapeutic alliance and has a personal role in the recovery process, decreasing the \npatien t’s feeling of being threatened or “controlled” through the treatment process. Patien ts \nare ex pected to honestly and accurately disclose information to nutritionists about history, \npresen t symptoms, current behaviors, and lapses or relapses, despite the eating disorders' \ntempta tions and\n intim idations. A clea r stance should be taken against the problem, \nemphas izing the main priority of the alliance: aiding the process of recovery towards those \nissues that have been identified as difficult for the patient (not necessarily clinical symptoms) \nand wh at the patient feels are the important goals of treatment. The pa tient is an active \npartic ipant and is accountable for his or her actions in the quest for behavior change and \nimprov ement of quality of life. Imposi tions will be operated only in relation to safety issues. \nIn the se situations, staff should clearly communicate to patients their intentions to take care of \nthem a nd not engage in control battles, nor punish patients with aversive techniques. \nThe de gree to which the autonomy of the patient is supported is often the degree to which \nthe pa tient perceives his or her locus of control within the treatment structure. Whenev er \npossib le, dietitians should foster lower environmental control over the patient’s behavior and \nincrea se responsibility and accountability of the patient for his or her own recovery and well-\nbeing. The th erapeutic alliance with respect to confidentiality, information provided to \nparent s, and crisis interventions should be discussed in a direct and clear manner during the \ninitia l consultation. A heal thcare provider does not need to obtain parental consent to provide \nconfid ential treatment to any youth, as long as the youth understands the benefits and \nconseq uences of the proposed treatment (12). Still, parents are assured that if there is \ndeteri oration, they will be notified. If the progress of recovery is slow, a decision may be \nmade t o increase the level of care.

Cre at ing a wide coalition against the disorders \nThe natu re of eating disorders dictates the necessity to create a wide and strong coalition \nagainst the disorder\n with co llaborative work employed by the interdisciplinary team (13). \nWhen wor king in community-based services, the nutritionist must communicate effectively \nwith out ward health care givers. If the d ietitian does not communicate effectively with other \nin or ou tward team members that co-treat the patient, a split among therapists with respect to \nbeliefs or approaches may occur, and the strength of the wide coalition may be cracked. This \nma y nurt ure the eating disorder and weaken the patient’s battle. A cohesi ve team of health \ncare pro viders, who may even span various organizations in the community, allows the youth \nand fami ly to see that everyone is on the same side working against the eating disorder. \nThe diet itian is obliged to support treatment goals within the guidelines of the nutrition \ncare pro cess and remain faithful to the messages and communication style agreed on by the \nteam (2) . Family m embers are a primary resource in recovery if they are assisted in learning \nhow to c ope during the crisis, to deal with the effects of the eating disorder, and to practice \nsupporti ve parenting approaches. To enrol l parents into the coalition against the eating \ndisorder , therapists express curiosity about those aspects with which the disease intimidated \nrelation ships within the family and how food, weight, and health are being abused by the \neating d isorder. The ther apist then invites parents to be part of the coalition against the \ndisorder , a coalition in which the patient is the protagonist, the multidisciplinary staff is the \nguiding map, and the family is an auxiliary ego. Parents present the third rib of the alliance, \nand than ks to their encouragement, the child’s persistence in the difficult battle is maintained. \nIndividu als and family members are invited to consider ways in which they can gather their \nstrength together to resist the problems. The fami ly’s/parents’ role is tailored to the stage of \nillness and to the patient’s age, in accordance with the therapeutic alliance. Nutritio n \ncounseli ng is focused on nutrition education as well as dividing responsibility according to \nthe stag es in the recovery process. Deciding how the parents can best support their child is \nmost imp ortant in the process of recovery. \n \nParent s' role may differ according to the institute’s approach \nIn some places, parents might be in charge of child eating and activity patterns, while in \nothers, the family will act as auxiliary ego and mainly has a supporting role. \nThe Maud sley approach, for instance (14, 15), involves the family from the outset of \ntreatmen t and relies heavily on parent involvement in the re-feeding of the child with an \neating d isorder. In this approach, parents take on the nurses' role and have a primary role in \nconfront ing pro-anorexic or bulimic behaviors. Parents are encouraged to separate the eating \ndisorder from the child while performing this task, and blame the eating disorder rather than \nthe chil d, therefore minimizing the escalation of expressed emotion.

Weight res toration 2. Returning control over eating to the adolescent 3. \nEstablishi ng healthy adolescent identity. This appro ach, however, is not for the faint-hearted; \nsome caree rs are somewhat skeptical and reluctant to be involved in family work (19). \nMoreover, oftentimes parents and patients are trapped in the care-taking position or the ill \nperson pos ition, respectively. The succes s of this approach seems to depend on the successful \nmotivation of parents to take on this task and see it through, while simultaneously supporting \nthe proces ses of adolescent development as they re-emerge, which is well documented (20). \nWhen suffe rers feel “invisible” in their families, this type of intense involvement may \nsuddenly a ct as a psychological facilitator in improving the overall relationship. It may hel p \nto make th e sufferer feel seen, cared about, and loved, but this approach does not fit all \nfamilies. Such an ap proach has disadvantages for families in which high levels of hostility or \ncriticism toward the AN adolescent are present. Engaging t hese families in treatment can be a \nchallenge (21). \nBased on a solution-oriented approach, Nardone et al. (22) presented a model to treat \neating wit h a systemic orientation. The author s suggest that direct or indirect attempts by the \nfamily to make the patient eat paradoxically increase his/her tendency to deny food and end \nup complic ating the problem instead of solving it. They sugge st that the family start a \n“conspirac y of silence,” i.e., stop intervening or even mentioning the problem. In giving this \nprescripti on, the authors emphasize the importance of avoiding criticism of past actions, or \nany implic ation that the family is somehow guilty. Instead, c ounsellors use injunctive \nlanguage, give positive connotations, and above all, avoid negative formulations, praising the \nparents fo r having been so patient at helping the daughter, being there for her, working to \navoid the situation. Although i t may seem strange, parents are asked to start observing \nwithout in tervening. They must absolutely avoid talking about the problem. When follo wed, \nthis presc ription, as the authors report, stops the usual solutions attempted by the family. This \nofte n lead s to surprising improvement in the eating disorder symptoms because it interrupts a \nretroactiv e vicious circle between the family and the young woman, which had been \nnourishing the problem (22). \nOther appr oaches suggest that eating issues and the eating disorder’s front should be \nmanaged be tween the nutritionist and the patient, while parents should revisit their primary \nrole – nur turing rather than feeding.

In contrast to the in- patient setting, in a \ncommunity-based settin g, food is negotiable and its quality and quantities are tailored to \npatients' readiness.

Thus, sometimes \nthe i nitial focus is o n maximizing the nutritional value of what is eaten, which can improve \nhealth and feelings of well-being, even before weight is gained. Legitimate food allerg ies and \npatients’ religious an d cultural practices should be considered and discussed to limit patient \nrationalizations for r estricted eating. For weight maintenance , Kaye et al.

The energy \nwasting of malnourishe d anorexia nervosa patients results in higher than normal resting \nenergy expenditure (41 ). \nThe physician in most units monitors the blood tests regularly (its frequency depends on \nthe setting and patien t's position), while the dietitian reintroduces food gradually, starting at \nonly 300-400 calories above the patient’s preadmission daily intake to reduce the risk of \nrefeeding syndrome and to support adherence.

Although the aim of most nutritional rehabilitation programs is to maintain a \nweight gain of approxima tely 400–800 g/week (1, 46), frequently the rate of weight gain is \nmuch slower due to perce ption that \"if you cannot fight them, join them.\" Davies and Jaffa \n(46) s uggest that the ra te of weight gain should be fast enough to avoid negative \n“institutionalization” e ffects of inpatient stay but not so fast as to cause overwhelming anxiety \nto the patient, nor to r esult in an unacceptable risk of developing refeeding syndrome.

This allows the individual t o become \nreacquainted with internal h unger and satiety cues while also changing behaviors, in order to \nmove away from restriction a nd the binge–purge cycle. Energy intake should initial ly be \nbased on the maintenance of weight to help limit hunger because this can be a trigger for a \nbinge. Purging behaviors do not com pletely inhibit use of calories from the binge; an average \nretention of 1,200 kcal occu rs from binges of various sizes and contents, and laxatives are \nineffective at minimizing en ergy absorption but do substantially increase water losses (50). \nTo promote normal bowel func tion, a fiber-rich diet is recommended. Patients are advised not \nto restrict fluid intake to avoid dehydration and worsening of constipation, and those with \nnormal ranged weight may ben efit from addition of regular physical activity, which assists in \nregulating bowel function. B inge eating is often precip itated by triggers such as negative \naffect, with overeating bein g identified as a tension-releasing coping mechanism, used to deal \nwith emotional distress (51) .

However , when these bulk agent s are misused, they have the same \npsychological consequences as regular laxatives. \nCognitive behavior techniques are implemented to help the patient identify maladaptive \nbehaviors and the associated c ognitions. The therapist’s first task is to help patients see that \ntheir dieting attempts are a p roblem since they are a major cause of preoccupation with \nthoughts about food and eating , they are anxiety provoking, and they restrict the way in which \npatients can eat. Rigid dietar y rules are couple d with the tendency to react in an extreme and \nnegative fashion to the interm ittent breaking of these rules. \nPatients are encouraged to sel f-monitor their daily behavior and thinking patterns, \nmapping the antecedents of mal adaptive behaviors. Learning and utilizing skills is an \nimportant component of CBT for eating disorders, and it is likely that effective skill use \nfacilitates symptom reduction. Usually, with CBT for eating d isorders, patients are taught \nskills (e.g., thought restruct uring, stimulus control techniques) and are asked to practice these \nskills between sessions (52). Food records are the most comm on instrument used to identify and address maladaptive \nbehaviors and cognitions. Self -monitoring is a central f eature of treatment for eating \ndisorders. It is recognized as a vehicle of data collection regarding a patient’s dietary intake as \nwell as associations between f ood intake, distressing situations, thoughts, emotions, and body \nimage experiences. Patients ar e encouraged to mon itor in the moment versus allowing \nsignificant time between an ex perience and recording the details of the experience. Food \nrecords may be formed in vario us levels of complexity. Initially, they may include de tails \nabout time, place, companionsh ip, and content of food eaten, as well as information regarding \nbinge/purge episodes. Further on, they may focus on monitoring hunger and satiety cues, \nemotional eating, and obsessiv e compulsive rites related to food and eating. They may focus \non qualitative as well as quan titative information. It is important that the dieti tian review self-\nmonitoring with the patient so that the patient can see the value of adhering to this aspect of \nthe program, not only for impr ovements in eating disorder symptoms, but also for their \noverall quality of life, throu gh increased knowledge of themselves and how they perceive and \nexperience the world (53). \nTh e cyclic nature of bulimic s ymptoms is perpetuated by negative effects and core \nbeliefs.

Food records are collaboratively discussed with the patient, and problem solving strategies are suggested. Since binge eating \ndisorder and bulimia nervosa sha re common psychological and behavioral characteristics, \nbinge eating disorder treatment has been highly influenced by bulimia nervosa treatment \nliterature that encompasses cogn itive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy (2). \nNormalization of eating behavior s is a primary goal, rather than weight loss, at any cost. \nWeight maintenance may be a pivo tal accomplishment and should be recognized as such \nby both the nutritionists and th e patient because this can be an indicator of fewer or decreased \nbinge episodes. In addition, app ropriate physica l activity components and leisure activities \nmay provide stress management an d also assist with energy balance. \n \n \n2. PROMOTE HEALTHY THINKING, E AT ING , AND ACTIVITY \nPATTERNS AND IMPROVE BODY IMAGE A. Normalizing eating and acti vi ty patterns. \nWith weight restoration, food ch oices increase, food hoarding decreases, and obsessions \nabout food decrease in frequency and intensity, although they do not necessarily disappear. \nGradual incorporation of “forbid den or feared foods” into the diet is an important goal in \nnutrition counseling to increase variety of food eaten and counter restricted behaviors that \nlimit patients’ possibilities. D uring this process, patients ar e overwhelmed with concerns \nabout their bodies. They describ e a fear of gaining weight and may often state that they would \nrather be dead than fat. \n \nDese nsitization \nDesensitizati on is a well known process in behavioral therapy. At the beginning of the \ntreatme nt process, patients are aided in creating a “feared or forbidden foods” list in which \nthey rank feared foods according to intensity of fear surrounding the particular foods (55). \nThrough the treatment process, p atients are assisted in neutralization of such fear through the \npractice of mindfulness and expo sure therapy using a graduated hierarchy of progressively \nmore feared foods. Mindfulness i s the guiding facto r for exposure therapy in that it sets the \nstage for a calm, focused, de-es calated, and nonjudgmental cognitive set for the experience. \nExposure to other anxiety-provok ing activities such as eating in a restaurant or eating with \nfriends is often conducted, firs t verbally and then by modeling and simulating grocery \nshopping or eating out in restau rants. These situations allow the patie nt to practice utilizing \nhealthy coping skills, such as p roblem-solving and mindfulness (55).

The \npsychobiological basis of hun ger a nd satiety and the relatedness of nutritional status and \nbehaviors to impaired concentratio n, indecisiveness, mood fluctuations, and sleep disturbance \nare discussed. The dietitian helps the patients d evelop an understanding of what they need \nfrom a physiological standpoint an d to learn how to apply it to their own bodies. The goal is \nto normalize food int ake, to help the individuals achieve normal satiety signals, so they can \nfuel themselves adequately to supp ort health and allow them to achieve their life goals. \nAlthough done before, the dietitia n addresses continually the potential difference between \nsubjective and objective measures of intake and collaboratively researches with the patients \nwhat is an “appropriate” portion f or them. \nThe dietitian discusses with patie nts the impact of the “numbers dictators” and helps \npatients choose alternative strate gies for self-regulation and control. Some prefer to stick to \ncalorie c ounting, while others are swept away to an obsessive course and would thus rather \nuse schemes of eating portions and food exchanges. \n \nMindful eating should be encoura ge d, and emotional eating should be countered and its \npattern explored.

Treating dysfunctional though ts re lated to food, shape and weight \nPoor body image at the end of trea tment predicts poor prognosis (56).

Mirror exposure \ninvolves deliberate , planned, and sy stematic exposure to body image. The approach is \nnonjudgmental, holi stic in focus, an d mindful of present emotional experience. \nComplementary behavioral assignments aim to reduce avoidance and excessive checking \n(58). \nThe clinician may use narrati ve ther apy, which studies the internalized oppressive ideas \nin cultural, political, and social c ontext (7). Most counsellors find it very produc tive when \nthey share with the patients their p ersonal experience in balancing their eating habits. \nMahatma Gandhi said, “You must be th e change you wish to see in the world.” Thus \ncounsellors should be good rol e mode ls, modeling positive body acceptance by eliminating \nnegative self statements. \n \nC. Mana ging body checking behavior s. S ome dietitians incorporate strategi es of abolishing body checking behaviors. Body \nchecking is the practice of re peated ly checking aspects of one’s body in a range of ways (59). \nThese behaviors include examining sp ecific body parts, using the fit of clothing or jewelry to \njudge shape or weight, frequent weig hing, and studying oneself in the mirror repeatedly. Each \nepisode might last from a few second s to a number of minutes. Fairburn et al. hypothesized \nthat b ody checking magnifies perceiv ed imperfections, serving to maintain body size \npreoccupation and the fear of losing control (thus maintaining dietary restriction). Because \npatients pay attention to e ven small changes, slight (and normal) fluctuations in weight can \ntrigger mood change (60). \nMountford et al. (61) suggested that for an intervention to be successful in eliminating \nunhealthy checking or avoidance, the individual’s underlying cognitions must be explicitly \nobserved and challenged, as it is li kely that a few key beliefs will underlie a number of \nbehaviors. The therapist may ask pat ients why i t is so important for them not to have to check \ntheir bodies every ten minutes.

A lso, patient are trained to “get back on track” as quickly \nas possible once a lapse has occurred. It is important that patients are prep ared for \nvulnerability to relapses during high- risk times. Patients are aided in identifying pers onal \ntriggers and high-risk situations that may promote relapse and are trained through \nmindfulness to utilize awareness to re cognize, prior to the lapse, that they have a choice in \nwhich behaviors they will choose, give n the situation. In addition, patterns of thinking and destructive behaviors that may trigger relapse are identified. Patients are coached on how to \nrefram e lapses as “slips” versus a com plete relapse (55). \nWhen patients are experiencing the urg e to lapse to maladaptive behaviors (restrictions, \nbinging, or purging), they are invited to phone their dietitian prior to engaging in such \nbehaviors. \nWisniewski & Ben Porat (64 ) suggested using telephone skill coaching with DBT \nframework. They describe a telephone-b ased, semi- structured procedure that involves \nascertaining the problem, evaluating w hat the patient has already tried to solve the problem, \nand developing, getting commitment for , and minimizing problems with an action plan. \nGenerally, the goal of telephone skill coaching is to empower the caller to make a decision \nregarding the current crisis and to ta ke appropriate action. In standard DBT treatment, \ntelephone coaching is used to assist c lients in generalizing the skills they are learning in \ntreatment to everyday situations (11). Eating disorder patients are likely to become \ndysregulated when exposed to food-rela ted stimuli as well as to interpersonal interactions. In \nsuch conditions, they might find a sho rt conversation with their dietitian helpful to avoid \nrelapse. The therapist needs to refrai n from pr oviding therapy and/or offering interpretative \nremarks regarding current behavior dur ing telephone skill-coaching, as this attention could \npossibly reinforce crisis behavior (64 ). Interpretations regarding the episode, therefore, should \nbe left for the individual session. Solution focused strategy \nSolution fo cused also offers technique s to overcome relapses. When some symptoms are \nre-engaged, th e therapist may use tech niques to remind the patient how he felt without the \ntyranny of the eating disorder. The “a s if” technique is a useful tool in these situations. It is \naimed to induce a positive, sol ution-o riented self-deception, where the fantasy of having \novercome the problem becomes a self-fu lfilling prophecy.

A comprehensive literature review demonstrates that there are at least ten definitions of recovery from AN, differentiated according to several criteria: definition of normal weight; inclusion of only behavioral vs. both behavioral and psychological recovery; inclusion of comorbidity and overall psychosocial functioning in addition to eating-related recovery; and the minimal time required to define recovery. These discrepancies likely account for the wide variation in the range of patients defined as recovered from AN in different outcome studies (0-92%). A great variability also exists with respect to the factors predicting recovery. Another limitation to the research on factors that predict recovery in AN is that most outcome studies have used univariate analyses for this purpose, enabling the assessment of only separate independent predictors. By contrast, multivariate quantitative models allow for the measurement of the relative contribution of each variable for recovery, as well as for the assessment of the cumulative predictive power of all variables included. ‡‡‡‡ E-mail address: michalyg2000@gmail.com 2012.

St ill, an overall worse prognosis has \nbe en found repeatedly to be associated with several factors: body image disturbances, \nco mpulsive exercising, comorbid anxiety disorders (particularly obsessive compulsive \ndi sorder), personality disorders and non-clinical personality traits, poor social skills, \nlo nger duration of illness prior to treatment, and shorter follow-up.

Fo r example, for patients who are not fully remitted, treatment may be increased or \nch anged, whereas treatment can be discontinued if recovery is reached (3). Re grettably, the \nst udy of the exact criteria required is hampered by problems such as the prolonged course of \nAN until recovery is reached and the high relapse rate of the disorder within a relatively brief \nti me period (4,5), as well as because of difficulties in defining and agreeing on standard \ncr iteria for recovery (2,5,6). Cu rrently, definitions vary widely with respect to the required \ncr iteria and the duration required for recovery, creating difficulties in comparing the course \nan d outcome of AN across different studies. \n T he aim of the present chapter is to provide a critical description of the different \nde finitions for recovery from AN, emphasizing theoretical, clinical, and research-related \nco nclusions associated with each definition. We further aim to provide a better understanding \nof the meaning of the distinction between remission and recovery. Th is distinction is of \ngr eater relevance in AN in comparison to other psychiatric disorders because of the high \nmo rtality, morbidity, and relapse rate associated with this disorder (5,7,8). La stly, we relate to \nth e critical issue of the relevant biopsychosocial dimensions influencing the course and \nou tcome of AN and the complex interactions occurring among these dimensions in the all-\nim portant process of recovery. Re commendations for future research are also provided. DE FINITIONS OF OUTCOME IN ANOREXIA NERVOSA De finitions of response to treatment, remission, and recovery in AN vary widely in the \nre search literature, and reflect considerable confusion between these terms. De finitions differ \nbo th with respect to the criteria required and the duration of time needed to define them. \nAc cording to Couturier & Lock (6): \nRe sponse to treatment – A significant clinical change or a significant change in a specific \nin dex (e.g. a score on an assessment scale) following a period of treatment, as compared to \nth e baseline period.

Prob ably the oldest and most commonly used scale for assessing the outcome of \nAN i s the Morgan-Russell Scale (10). This scale defines three possible outcomes: good, \ninte rmediate, and poor, based on criteria of weight and menstruation. A “g ood” outcome is \ndefi ned as weight not less than 85% of normal weight range according to age, gender, and \nheig ht, combined with the presence of normal and regular menstruation. An “ intermediate” \noutc ome is defined as weight not less than 85% of the normal range, but menstruation is \nunst able, and/or irregular. A “p oor” outcome is defined as weight lower than 85% of the \nnorm al weight range and the absence or near absence of menstruation. This instrument is \nlimi ted in that an individual may be defined as fully recovered based on normal weight and \nmens truation, while still displaying pathological attitudes and behaviors regarding eating and \nbody weight. The minimal duration required to define any outcome with the Morgan-Russell \nScal e is 8 weeks. \nAs a n alternative, Strober and associates (5) have defined “good recovery” as a good \noutc ome according to the Morgan-Russell Scale, whereas “full recovery” is defined as \nabse nce of all symptoms, both behavioral and preoccupational/attitudinal required for the \ndiag nosis of AN. Acco rdingly, “full recovery” requires normal body weight, menstruation \nand eating related behaviors, and the absence of preoccupations and maladaptive attitudes \nconc erning weight and shape. The other possible outcomes (partial recovery and poor \nreco very) are defined according to the Morgan-Russell criteria. The minimal duration \nrequ ired to define a respective outcome according to Strober et al (5) is similar to that of the \nMorg an-Russell Scale, namely 8 weeks. \nStei nhausen and Glanville (11) modified the semi-structured interview of Stuzenberger et \nal ( 12) to develop a scale that would define recovery from AN not only qualitatively (i.e., \npres ent or absent), but also from a quantitative (i.e., extent of recovery) perspective \n(11, 13,14). Furt hermore, this scale defines recovery with respect to both ED symptomatology \nand sexual and psychological functioning. Each of its 11 factors is scored on a scale of four \npoin ts, reflecting severity and frequency (absent, minimal, moderate, or severe). Thes e ratings \nlead to three scores: 1. An E D score, based on five factors – restricting behaviors, bingeing, \nvomi ting, use of laxatives, and amenorrhea; 2. A ps ychosocial score based on six factors – \nlack of interest in sex, abstinence from sexual activity, unsatisfying interpersonal \nrela tionships, dependence on one’s family, unsatisfying social life, and a deficient \nprof essional career; 3. A ge neral score based on all eleven factors, which encompasses both \nthe ED and the psychosocial functioning score. \nHerz og et al (15) have developed another scale assessing recovery from AN, the \nPsyc hiatric Status Rating Scale (PSR).

For ex ample, “full/good recovery” are defined as eight consecutive weeks with \na PSR score of 1 or 2, respectively, whereas “partial recovery” can be defined as eight \nconsec utive weeks with PSR score of 3 or 4, or less than eight consecutive weeks with PSR \nscore of 1 or 2 (15). \nEckert et al (16) has developed another scale consisting of seventeen items, based on the \ncriter ia of the Morgan-Russell Scale and on Garfinkel et al’s (17) Global Clinical Score. \nScorin g is based on a general rating of clinical outcomes as well as on sixteen items \nencomp assing current weight and height, and pathology in seven areas: AN like behaviors \nand/or attitudes, menstruation, sexual attitudes and behaviors, social adjustment, educational \nand/or occupational adjustment, and psychological adjustment. Scores are based on the past \nsix mo nths. Each i tem is rated on a four-point scale, from “absent” to “extreme.” Data f rom \nthis s cale classify each case into one of four recovery categories: recovered, good outcome, \ninterm ediate outcome, and poor outcome. \nKaye a nd his group (18) defined recovery from AN as a condition requiring normal \nweight (defined as weight of 90% of average body weight) and menstruation (defined as 10-\n12 men strual cycles in 12 months), as well as complete abstinence from bingeing, purging \nand re strictive eating behaviors for at least 12 months prior to assessment. This g roup was the \nfirst to define normal menstruation in term of number of cycles required, and among the first \nto req uire a prolonged 12-month duration criterion. \nCasper (19) uses criteria similar to those of most other studies, but also adds a \nrequir ement for a substantial improvement in eating-related preoccupations and in attitudes \nrelate d to food, physical appearance, and weight. Accord ingly, Casper defines a “good \nrecove ry outcome” or “physiological recovery” as body weight within 85% or more of \naverag e body weight along with regular menstruation. “Psych ological recovery” is \nestabl ished based on results of a rating scale, the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) (20), \nwith “ full recovery” defined as physiological recovery together with a score within no more \nthat t wo standard deviations from the normal EAT-26 score.

Similar pr oblems exist in the definition of normal \nmenstruati on, often leading to poor inter-rater reliability (25). Varying de finitions of “normal \nweight” an d “normal menstruation” may also affect the time frame (ranging from 8 weeks to \n3 years) r equired for recovery. \nFrom a dif ferent perspective, recovery rates in AN may also reflect in part the assessment \ntool used, i.e., higher rates in the case of rating scales, and lower rates if clinical interviews \nare used ( 26). Moreover, with the exception of Kordy et al (21) and Pike (23), none of the \ncriteria p roposed differentiate remission from recovery, except for the criterion of time, \ndespite th e likelihood of earlier remission representing a good predictor of later recovery (3). \nLastly, mo st of the studies so far relate to adult female populations. Studying m ales likely \nrequires a whole different set of criteria, which have still not been studied in depth. Similarly, the defini tion of recovery in adolescents is likely even more ambiguous than in adults, \nbecause re covered adolescents may have still not reached their final adult height (and in turn, \ntheir idea l weight), or not have had their first menstrual period. In this re spect, the issue of \nmenstruati on represents a major problem in the study of recovery in AN, because periods are \noften irre gular even in recovered patients, and many adolescent and young adult females \nnowadays u se contraceptives. \n \n \nRECOVE RY R ATES IN ANOREXIA NERVOSA \n \nAN is a ch ronic disorder, with recovery occurring mostly after 4-10 years from the onset \nof the ill ness (2,9), although it may happen even after 15 years of illness (9).

The earliest predictive factors are \nrelated to t he time of onset of the illness, usually assessed with retrospective descriptions of \npatient and family during the index follow-up assessment, or according to medical charts. \nOther predic tors of recovery can be assessed prospectively from different relevant points \nduring the c ourse of the illness, e.g., the return of the menstrual cycle (physical point of \nreference), when leaving home for college (psychosocial point of reference) or upon \ndischarge fr om inpatient treatment (treatment-related point of reference). \nAlthough a w ide range of predictive factors have been found in different studies, \nreflecting t he wide variability in the definition of recovery, the design of the outcome study, \nand the leng th of the follow-up period, several parameters seem repeatedly to have a greater \npower to pre dict outcome than others. The followin g summary of data is based on the reviews \nof Herzog et al, (27) Pike (23), and Steinhausen (2), as well as on more recent data: \n1.

By contrast, h ysterical personality has been linked to an overall more \nfavorable outc ome (2). \nNon-clinical p ersonality traits - Elevated levels of personality attributes such as harm \navoidance, rig idity, inhibition, perfectionism and obsessionality, have been associated \nwith an overal l worse prognosis of AN in several long-term outcome studies (2,33,40), as \nwell as in stu dies comparing recovered AN to non-ED control patients (41). \n3. Other demog rap hic, psychosocial, and treatment-related factors – The association \nbetween age at onset of the AN and prognosis is inconclusive, with younger age being \nlinked to a be tter outcome in most (2,9,23), although not all (27) studies.

With respect to psychosocia l effects, the presence of disturbed parent-child relationships (2,27) and \npoor social sk ills (5,42) has been linked to an unfavorable outcome, particularly in \nadolescent AN. 4. Quantitativ e M odels for the Prediction of Outcome in Anorexia Nervosa \nAnother limita tion in the investigation of predictors of recovery in AN is that most \noutcome studie s use univariate analyses for this purpose, enabling the assessment of only \nseparate indep endent predictors.

The \nuse of a regr essio n equation correctly predicted non-remission in 87.0% of the cases \n(sensitivity) and remission in 94.4% of the cases (specificity). It further explain ed 91.5% of \nthe variance for n on remission, considerably higher than the respective values in previous \nstudies (13.2-45%) . The explained vari ance (R\n2\n) of this equati on was high: R\n2\n=0.724. The \nacc ur acy of t he di agnostic test of this model, depending on its ability to correctly separate \nremitted from non- remitted AN patients, was excellent [the area under the receiver operating \ncharacteristic cur ve (ROC) (49) equaled 0.938]. \nThree follow-up va riables contributed to non-remission from AN: vegetarianism, higher \ntotal follow-up Ea ting Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2) (50) score, and lower BMI .The use of a \nregr ession equatio n correctly identified non-remission in 65.2% of the cases (sensitivity), and \nremission in 88.9% of the cases (specificity), correctly explaining 79.7% of the variance for \nnon-remission. The explained vari ance of this equation was high: R\n2\n=0.621, and the ac curacy \nof the diagnostic test of this model was excellent (the area under the ROC curve equaled \n0.907). \nThe use o f univari ate analyses showed that that remitted patients had elevated anxiety \nand eating-related obsessionality compared to the controls, suggesting that these variables \nmay predispose to AN. In this respect, t he results of this study highlight the specific role of \nanxiety in increas ing the risk for both the predisposition to AN and for non-remission. \nAnother Israeli st udy by Bachner-Melman and associates (51) explored the implications \nof adopting differ ent definitions of recovery. Two hundred and tw enty-five women with a \nlifetime diagnosis of AN were interviewed, diagnosed, and assessed for level of recovery. \nWhen broad criteri a for recovery were adopted (BMI of at least 19, regular menstruation for \nat least three mon ths, and no bingeing or purging behaviors for at least eight consecutive \nweeks), 74 women ( 33%) were defined as recovered. When a more string ent definition was \nused (adding lack of body image distortion and fear of fatness to the aforementioned criteria), \nonly 32 women (14% ) were classified as recovered. The 32 women fulfi lling the more \nstringent criteria were referred to as “behaviorally and cognitively recovered”, whereas the 42 \nwomen who had reco vered according to the broad but not the stringent criteria were referred \nto as “behaviorall y recovered”. \nA battery of self- rating scales measuring current ED symptomatology (disordered eating, \nbody dissatisfacti on, and drive for thinness) and core ED-related personality characteristics \n(endorsement of th e thin ideal concern for appropriateness, drive for success, fear of failure, \nharm avoidance, ob","section":"p11"}

Whereas some of the traits differentiating between the two samples might \nreflect the conseque nces of prior illness, the assumed absence of confounding nutritional \ninfluences in recove red patients raises the possibility of assessing in this case potential \nvulnerability factor s that predispose certain individuals to the development of AN (18). On \nthe other hand, the lack of difference between cognitively recovered AN women and never-ill \ncontrols, raises the possibility that these personality traits may actually be associated with the \ncondition of the ill ness (i.e., appearing in behaviorally but not cognitively recovered patients). \n \n \nDISCUSSION, CONC LU SI ONS, AND DIRECTION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH \n \nThe present chapte r presents the multitude of problems associated with the study of \nrecovery from AN. Ba sed on the finding s described; we highlight several points for further \ndiscussion. \n1. Crit eria for reco ver y: in the ongoing disagreement between favoring “narrow” and \n“broad” criteria for recovery, Couturier and Lock (6) favor the second option, as their \ndefinition of recove ry requires normal weight range (likely associated with an overall \nstable physical cond ition) and lack of pathological eating-related behaviors and attitudes. \nWe agree with most o f the researchers excluding the condition of comorbid disorders \nfrom the definition of recovery, as many studies have shown elevated comorbidity to be \npresent even in a hi gh percentage of recovered AN patients (2,48). Still, since \ncomorb idity may affe ct the functioning of AN patients above and beyond the influence of \nthe ED per se, we su ggest adding an evaluation of psychosocial functioning to Couturier \nand Lock’s (6) crite ria, so that recovery would reflect, at least to some extent, the \npatient’s overall co ndition. \n2. Behavioral vs. ps ych ological recovery: The study by Bachner-Melman et al (51) supports \nprevious studies (5,","section":"p12"}

Behavioral vs. ps ych ological recovery: The study by Bachner-Melman et al (51) supports \nprevious studies (5, 19) in emphasizing the differences between behavioral and \npsychological recove ry, and that in order to lead a normal productive life, it is not enough \nfor the recovered AN patient to be in an overall stable physical condition and to eat well. \nThe persistence of e ating and weight-related obsessionality and of pathological attitudes \ntoward the body may considerably interfere with occupational, social, and sexual \nfunctioning despite the presence of physical and behavioral recovery (14,23). Moreover, \nstudies f ocusing on the patients\" own perspectives have shown that factors such as \npersonality strength , self-confidence, identification and expression of emotions, and \nfeeling understood ( 53), as well as feeling a connection within oneself and others and that \nlife has a meaning ( 54), are important ingredients of recovery. It is our opinion, t herefore, \nthat outcome studies should relate to both definitions of recovery and to the similarities \nand differences in t he factors predicting them. \n3. Methodological co nsi derations: In our opinion, outcome studies in AN should combine \nprospective longitud inal designs assessing the patient’s condition at different time points \nduring the course of the illness, with follow-up comparisons of recovered, non-recovered, \nand non-ED participa nts, analyzing the results with quantitative statistical models.

Recovery in male AN pa tients: Understandably, most outcome studies in AN have related \nonly to female patient s, with only a few studies including additional small samples of \nmale patients. This pr ecludes the for mulation of adequate recovery criteria in this \npopulation at the pres ent time. It is most likely that gender differences beyond the issue \nof menstruation would be found in the process of recovery from AN. \n5. Recovery vs. remiss ion : Only the two studies of Couturier and Lock (3,6) have attempted \nto differentiate direc tly between remission and recovery from AN. According to these \nau thors, the only diff erence between the two constructs is shorter vs. longer duration, \nrespectively. The rati onale for this paradigm is plausible, allowing for the investigation of \na putative association between short-term remission and long-term recovery, and for the \ncomparison of factors predicting the two conditions. Nevertheless, in our o pinion, \nduration is not the on ly factor that should differentiate between recovery and remission. \nRemission may differ f rom recovery not only on clinical but also on theoretical grounds. \nFor example, we believ e that psychological (or cognitive) recovery should be part of the \ndefinition of long-ter m recovery, but not of short-term, potentially temporary, remission. \nIf that is the case, f uture research should determine the factors increasing or decreasing \nthe likelihood of prog ressing from remission to recovery.

In keeping with the mo re broad \ndifferentiation betwee n remission and recovery, Pike (23) suggests that although similar \nclinical criteria are required for both conditions, recovery can, nevertheless, be attained \nonly when the overall functioning and risk of recurrence of the ED symptoms is \ncomparable to that of never-ill women \n6. The interrelationsh ips between recovery and relapse: The ambiguity in the definition of \nrecovery likely leads also to considerable problems in the characterization of relapse. In \nparticular, should rel apse be established only if a full AN syndrome recurs, or is the mere \nreappearance of interf ering symptoms sufficient? Secondly, what is the minimum \nduration of a symptom- free condition required to define symptomatic reappearance as a \nrelapse, rather than a part of an index episode? \nIn conclusion, the stu dy of recovery from AN and of the factors increasing or decreasing \nits likelihood of is o f vital importance. Although many outcome studies do exist, the \nmultitudes of problems in defining recovery, and the great variations among the studies, still \npreclude a uniform def inition of the construct. In light of these find ings, the standardization of \nthe definition for rec overy from AN and of the design of future outcome studies is of vital \nimportance to improve our ability to compare the results of different studies, to draw sound \nconclusions, and to pl an appropriate treatment interventions. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] Ho ek HW.

Chapter 16 RECOVERY IN BULIMIA NERVOSA Phillipa Hay ***** Foundation Chair of Mental Health, School of Medicine, University of Western Sydney, NSW, Australia, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, James Cook University, Australia Abstract This chapter addresses first issues in definition around the question of recovery in bulimia nervosa (BN), next the natural history, and third the outcome with treatment including predictors that may be modified to enhance remission and reduce relapse or later recurrence rates. Remission in BN is most often defined as the absence of binge eating and purging behaviours. In addition some studies have used reduction in psychopathology as an alternate indicator of recovery. These studies were based on a quantitative measure of eating disorder weight/shape (or other) concerns e.g. being less than one standard deviation above the community mean of the global Eating Disorder Examination score. There is a consensus that remission is most likely sustained after one year and relapse after that time may be termed recurrence. Naturalistic studies suggest that about half or more of those with BN may have a good outcome in the longer-term, but for the remainder the disorder is persistent. Treatment outcome studies indicate that for those who engage in specific interventions and evidence based treatments (particularly psychotherapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy for bulimia nervosa) developed since the 1980s the likelihood of recovery is significantly increased. Whilst there are mixed outcomes in studies of prognostic factors, consistent pre-treatment factors identified include a history of psychological advsersity, borderline personality structure, depression and obesity. Consistent post-treatment prognostic features are achieving abstinence and good psychosocial adjustment. Thus treatments should address improving psychological resiliency, coping and co-morbidities.

Phillipa Hay 21 8 \nIN TRODUCTION Bu limia nervosa is a ‘modern’ eating disorder. It was first delineated in the late twentieth \nce ntury and was the first eating disorder to be characterised by recurrent binge eating, namely \nep isodes of eating unusually large amounts of food over which there is a sense of loss of \nco ntrol, in people of normal or above average body weight [1,2]. By definition, the sufferer of \nbu limia nervosa also engages in compensatory extreme weight-control behaviours. Th ese \nbe haviours may take the form of self-induced vomiting and/or laxative or diuretic use \n(p urging), or fasting and/or intense exercise (the non-purging form of bulimia nervosa). Fe w \nch anges to the impending revised American Psychiatric Association criteria are proposed, \nex cepting to reduce the minimum frequency of binge eating and purging behaviours to once \nwe ekly [3].

In addition to disordered eating behaviours, people with bulimia nervosa \nal so have specific eating disorder psychopathology whereby their self-view or self-evaluation \nis unduly influenced by concerns about their weight and/or shape [1]. \nBu limia nervosa is common, and early cohort and clinical incidence studies [4,5] support \nan increase in the incidence of bulimia nervosa in the decade following its recognition in \n19 80, to be followed by a plateau or even a decrease in the 1990s and past decade [6]. A sy stematic review has put the estimated incidence of bulimia nervosa at 12 cases per 100,000 \npe r year [7]. Fi ndings from national surveys in North America [8] and Europe [9] indicate \nth at the 12-month prevalence of bulimia nervosa is around 0.3-0.5% in the general population \nan d in Australian samples current or point prevalence of bulimia nervosa is similar [10]. \nBu limia nervosa is also a disorder with high morbidity. In community and clinic surveys \nbu limia nervosa and like eating disorders have been found to have significant impact on \nhe alth related quality of life and adaptive function [11,12]. Fo rtunately, specific and \nef ficacious psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies have been developed for bulimia nervosa \n[1 3]. Th is chapter will address first issues in definition around the question of recovery in \nbu limia nervosa, next the natural history, and third the outcome with treatment including \npr edictors that may be modified to enhance remission and reduce relapse or later recurrence \nra tes. WH AT IS MEANT BY RECOVERY? Th ere are several ways to approach the question of what is meant by recovery in bulimia \nne rvosa. Is this recovery with or without treatment? Wh en is remission recovery? In evitably, \nre covery is defined according to remission sustained over time (one year in the Kordy \nco nsensus definition [14]) such that the likelihood of relapse is remote, and after which time \nth e term recurrence may be preferred. \nDe finitions of remission are problematic. In a large recent review of 79 patient series \nSt einhausen and colleagues found 22 synonyms for remission (including ‘abstinent’) [15]. \nDi ffering definitions may lead to different rates of remission being reported. Fo r example, in \na 3-year trial of 334 eating disorder patients [16] remission of the 126 participants with \nbu limia nervosa was 30.2% when defined as absence of extreme figure (shape) preoccupation \nan d no vomiting/laxative use or binge-eating [14], but up to 44.4% when defined as absence \nof behaviours only using the criteria of Shapiro et al. (no binge-eating, vomiting or laxatives) \n E BSCOhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:25:04 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

NA TU RALISTIC OUTCOME STUDIES OF BULIMIA NERVOSA \n \nIt i s difficult to study the natural course of bulimia nervosa. Ther e are many longitudinal \ngene ral populations and similar studies, but few include large samples of people with eating \ndiso rders and even fewer samples of people meeting criteria for bulimia nervosa. For exam ple, Patton and colleagues [23] followed 107 adolescents with an eating disorder over a \n10-y ear period. Thei r findings suggested partial eating disorders were unlikely to progress to \nfull eating disorders, but were associated with significantly increased psychiatric co-\nmorb idity and persistent underweight. Howe ver, this study of a young cohort cannot be \ngene ralised to older samples with full syndromes of bulimia nervosa which has onset in later \nadol escence and young adulthood, albeit that the age of onset may be decreasing [24]. \nA na turalistic community based 5-year full syndrome study [25] of adult women with \nbuli mia nervosa (n=102) and binge eating disorder (BED) found that 31% and 15% continued \nto h ave bulimia nervosa at 15 months and at 5 years respectively. At f ive years half of the \nbuli mia nervosa sample (36 of 74) still met diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (24 with \neati ng disorders not otherwise specified [EDNOS]) while only 15% (5 of 34) of those with \nBED met diagnostic criteria. Alth ough the McKnight longitudinal naturalistic 4-year outcome \nstud y of BED [26] indicated only a small proportion of BED recover spontaneously, a less \nfavo urable outcome for bulimia nervosa compared to EDNOS and BED has also been \nrepo rted in a large (n=385) 4-year prospective study of a mixed sample where participants \nwere recruited from both clinic and community settings (through media advertisement) [27]. \nIn t his study remission was defined as the first point after entry to the trial when the \npart icipant had no DSM-IV eating disorder diagnosis (during the preceding 6 months), and \nrela pse was defined as the first time after a remission when symptoms for any eating disorder \ndiag nosis including EDNOS were found. At t he 4-year follow-up, 47% of those with bulimia \nnerv osa were remitted compared to 78% of EDNOS, 82% of the BED group, and 57% of \nanor exia nervosa participants [27]. A mo re recent but smaller 5-year naturalistic study of 23 \npeop le with bulimia nervosa found a 74% remission at 5 years, with a 47% probability of \nrela pse within the 5-year follow-up study of those in remission [28]. \nThe inconsistencies in these studies, namely in the course and outcome of people with \neati ng disorders from community samples, may occur when individuals affected do or do not \n EBS COhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:25:04 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Most o f those in the Agras et al. study did receive \ntreatm ent [27] but this was not the case in the Fairburn et al. study [25] where 28% of those \nwith b ulimia nervosa and only 3% of BED participants had treatment. Ben-To vim and \ncollea gues [29] studied the effects of treatment in a sample of people with eating disorders \nfollow ed for five years after presentation to treatment services (see also below). Neithe r this \nnor th e 5-year naturalistic Oxford study [25] found a relationship between receiving treatment \nfor an eating disorder and outcome. This d oes not of course mean treatment is ineffective, but \nrather that within the myriad of factors that influence outcome in the uncontrolled setting of \nnatura listic studies, it is difficult to find a significant effect for specific interventions. The \nl arge number of features that may influence course (in either clinical or community \npopula tions) include psychosocial stresses, inter-current psychiatric illness and co-\nmorbid ities, and personal vulnerability from innate characteristics, such as lower levels of \npsycho logical maturity reported in women with eating disorders [30,31]. Relati onships can be \ncomple x, and those important at onset or early in the illness course may differ from those that \nmainta in and perpetuate illness. For ex ample, Ball and Lee [32] investigated the relationship \nbetwee n stress and coping in a general population sample of women with disordered eating \nover s ix-months. They r eported strong cross-sectional, but weak longitudinal relationships \nbetwee n stressful life events and eating disorder symptoms [32]. Stice [33] also evaluated \nlongit udinal studies of mixed samples in a meta-analytic review and found some support for \neating disorder attitudes, such as body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, and negative affect as \nmainte nance factors (the last a causal maintenance factor) for bulimic symptoms. Hay an d \ncollea gues investigated the 2-year course and putative predictors of outcome of 87 young \ncommun ity women with disordered eating (63% with recurrent binge eating), although only \n13 had full syndrome bulimia nervosa [34]. In thi s study eating disorder psychopathology \nremain ed high and mental health quality of life (MHQoL) remained poor over the 2 years \n[34]. A high er baseline level of immature defence style significantly predicted higher levels \nof eat ing disorder symptoms, poorer MHQoL and more disability as measured by ‘days out of \nrole’ [34]. In add ition, higher educational attainment, baseline general psychological \ndistur bance, lower body mass index (kg/m\n2\n; BM I) , and having main work outside the home, \nwere a ssociated with poorer MHQoL. \nRetros pective nationwide community based twin studies of outcome have also been \nconduc ted by Wade and colleagues (in Australia) [35] and Keski-Rahkonen and colleagues \n[36] ( in Finland) with consistent findings.

Genetic and socio-cultural features (especially body dissatisfaction) are \nrelevant predispositions, and symptom severity. In addit ion, poor psychological resiliency, \npoor hea lth literacy, and past sexual abuse are putative maintaining factors. Whilst i t has \nproven d ifficult to show an effect on a population level for such prognostic features or \ntreatmen t, interventions that have reduced symptoms and morbidity remain important for the \nindividu al and society they live in. This wil l be discussed in the next section which addresses \noutcomes with treatments and identified prognostic attributes. \n \n \nOUTC OM ES WITH TREATMENT \n \nThe ma jo rity of longitudinal studies of outcome in bulimia nervosa have in fact been \nfrom cli nical case series and other treatment samples rather than naturalistic or community \nsamples as described in the previous section. For exam ple, in the NICE [20] systematic \nreview o nly two of more than 20 outcome studies identified in bulimia samples were not from \na treatm ent series. Findings have similarly been mixed or inconsistent and studies have been \nof widel y varying duration. \nTwo long er-term 10-year studies of BN following treatment [38,39] report a generally \npositive outcome.

In particula r, the role of problematic interpersonal function, often with a history of \npoor early l ife attachment and/or abuse, and features of borderline personality structure are \nreceiving at tention in treatment developments such as the ‘transdiagnostic’ broad cognitive \nbehaviour th erapy [22]. This therapy has additional modules addressing clinical \nperfectionis m, mood intolerance, interpersonal function, and low self-esteem.

Over the tim e of follow-up 96% received treatment, \n83 (75%) of those with bulimia nervosa achieved remission, and of these 29 (26% of total) \nrelapsed. Wh ilst remis sion rates were higher in bulimia nervosa, relapse rates were similar for \nboth eating disorders i.e. just over a third of those who remitted relapsed. The two vari ables \nthat emerged as significant in predicting relapse in the multivariate model were psychosocial \nfunction and level of weight and/or shape concerns. The authors concluded that (as in \ntreatment) r elapse prevention interventions should test approaches that may reduce body \nimage concer ns but also improve adaptive function and resiliency to stress. \n \n \nCONCLUSI ON Naturalist ic and treatment outcome studies indicate that between a third and a half of \npeople with bulimia nervosa will recover and a quarter or more will significantly improve in \nthe medium t o longer-term. It is likely that specific interventions and evidence based \ntreatments ( particularly psychotherapies such as congitive behaviour therapy for bulimia \nnervosa comb ined with SSRI treatment) developed since the 1980s increase the likelihood of \nrecovery. In addition, to optimise treatment specific to the the eating disorder addressing \nconcurrant p roblems, improving psychological resiliency and coping are promising areas for \nincreasing r ecovery and reducing relapse. \n EBSCOhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:25:04 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

This chapter addresses supervision in the treatment of eating disorders from two vantage points: case management and psychotherapy proper. With regard to case management, issues of hierarchy and leadership may influence the cohesiveness of the team and its therapeutic effectiveness and in this respect a structured eating disorders program has an advantage over an ad-hoc operation of private caregivers. With regard to psychotherapy, although cognizant and respectful of alternative and even more ubiquitous models of psychotherapy, the author has chosen to address the supervision of psychodynamic psychotherapy, congruent with her own orientation. The contemporary supervisory stance has parted from the previous purely didactic approach and recognizes the centrality of counter-transference. Unmotivated for change and difficult to treat, patients with eating disorders arouse in the therapist strong counter- transference reactions which reverberate in supervision: both therapists and supervisors are prone to experiencing frustration, anger, loss of value and confidence in their professional effectiveness. Traditional psychoanalytic devotion to the process, while delegating secondary attention to the symptoms is not realistic in eating disorders, notorious for their mortality risk. Artful navigation between activism and neutrality is one of the many challenges for both the therapist and the supervisor engaged in the endeavor.

An orexia nervosa (AN) alone has a high mortality risk (1, 2) including suicide, \nwh ich is a common cause of death among these patients (3). \nTh e front line intervention is therefore geared toward physiological stabilization, \nre storation of weight, normalization of alimentation and of aberrant eating habits and removal \n(o r at least reduction) of the obsession with food and weight.

This p sychiatrist \nexperi enced a certain frustration at carrying the bulk of the clinical responsibility while in \neffect filling only a marginal role vis-à-vis both patient and colleagues. This l atent annoyance \nturned into overt vexation when, a few months later, the patient reported that she will be \nseeing a substitute psychologist for a while, since her therapist is about to take maternity \nleave. The su rprised psychiatrist expressed disagreement with this recommendation and the \nsame e vening approached the psychotherapist to complain about the lack of communication \nand co llaboration. \"How i s it possible that you have not informed me and consulted with \nme?\" T he re action was: \"it is your fault! You sh ould have been more active in initiating \ncollab oration between us and least of all share your disagreement with the patient.\" The \np sychi atrist protested that it was the therapist who took one-sided initiatives, that a 3 month \n(the l ength of the maternity leave) substitute new therapist might not be such a good idea, \nversus the more logical alternative of increasing the frequency of the visits with him, a known \nfigure to the patient and an experienced therapist in his own right. The ps ychologist \ninsinu ated that both patient and parents would not feel comfortable with the psychiatrist as an \naltern ative therapist. It was not said whether this was therapist's own inference or a de-facto \ncommun ication by the patient. After a while, the patient declared herself sufficiently \nrecove red and in no further need of professional help. \nThis i s an example of a dysfunctional team, or in effect, a non-team, but rather a number \nof oth erwise esteemed professionals who instead of collaborating, worked in parallel, \ncompet ing for autonomy and leadership, and thus inadvertently collided along the way.

(12) \n T he sub jective experience of the supervisee during the training phase of his/her \ncareer v aries according to a number of factors, all orbiting around the three dyads involved: \ntherapis t-patient, therapist- own therapist (assuming that the supervisee is still undergoing \npersonal therapy), supervisor-therapist, and their respective matching personalities. \nAddressi ng the way supervisees evaluate their supervisors, Beinart (13) refers to the findings \nof D.R.G reen (author of \"Investigating the Core Skills of Clinical Supervision\", unpublished \nD. Clin. Psy ch. dissertation, University of Leeds-1988): \n\"using a qualitative research methodology Green found that special knowledge, \ncredibil ity and integrity were terms used by trainees to describe influential supervisors.\" \n(p.42) Some con gruence of theoretical orientation between supervisor and supervisee is \nnecessar y for a good working alliance of the supervisor-supervisee dyad, although one may \nargue th at exposure to diversity in theoretical paradigms enhances the learning process of the \ntrainees . \nThe spec trum of the supervisory stance in psychoanalytic psychotherapy may vary from a \ndidactic approach, at one end, which altogether avoids dealing with counter-transference, to \nan equal ly extreme position advanced by Balint (14) at the other end sustaining that the ideal \nsupervis or would be the supervisee's therapist himself. The grea t diversification in \npsychoan alytic theory and practice has generated over the years a multitude of supervisory \nmodels i n-between the two above mentioned poles. \nIn the P ost-qualification stage a less motivated trainee might discontinue the \nsupervis ion once his/her formal training requirements have been fulfilled, even though the \ncase pro gress might still benefit from additional guidance. \nAt the o pposite end, a dedicated therapist, although already formally qualified and even \nwith yea rs of experience, will unequivocally request supervisory assistance from a senior or \npeer and profit from it. Solnit ( 15) claimed that supervision, like psychoanalysis, is \nintermin able. \nIn many institutional programs, supervision of psychodynamic therapy is mandatory even \nfor qual ified therapists \nSetting: Psychodynamic therapy in eating disorders is often a complex proposition which \nin many respects cannot fully abide by the golden rules of practice. Public i npatient care has \nbeen inc reasingly shortened by heath policies, and unless there is a consecutive spectrum of \ndaycare and outpatient service available, in many such settings the stay is too brief to allow \nfor more than crisis intervention.

In most ea ting disorder centers the psychotherapy supervisors perform \nadditional functions (psychiatric care, group therapy, etc) and often are otherwise involved \nwith their supervisee's patients. However, t here are settings that adhere to a more canonic \nstance and \"import\" the psychotherapy supervisors. Those are not members of the staff, hold \nno organiz ational functions and usually meet the supervisees in their own offices, away from \nthe clinic . \n \n Team In te raction and Supervision: Eating disorders programs traditionally hold \ngroup teac hing activities in the format of case presentations either at the evaluation level (the \nso called \"intake meeting\") or as a treatment review. In additio n, there are study groups either \nat peer le vel or led by a senior professional, local or imported, for the purpose of either \nconsultati on or continuous case supervision. This group of people, the \"staff\", by the mere \nvirtue of working together will develop its own dynamics whether they sit in a circle in the \nmeeting ro om or by themselves in their respective offices. Issues, to mention a few, such as \nachievemen t ambitions, competition, envy, exhibitionism, shame, passivity, control but also \nidealizati on and love, will emerge in the discussion, and are not exclusively related to the \nmaterial p resented. Patients w ith eating disorders present common characteristics such as \nchronicity , repeated relapses, lack of compliance, self destructive behaviors including suicide \nattempts w hich in the long run wear out the care givers. It will be incumbent on the supervisor \nto determi ne the demarcation line between group supervision and group therapy, a perennial \nchallenge in all forms of psychotherapy supervision. A not unco mmon occurrence is counter-\ntransferen tial (supervisor vis-à-vis the group) causing the supervisor too to feel inadequate or \nineffectiv e, short of providing rescue solutions and subject to controversies as illustrated in \nthe follow ing case. \n \nCase Vig ne tte 2 \nSally, 42 years of age, suffered from chronic AN-Purging Type since age 15.

The \"speci al position\" transpired to some \nmembers of the staff, in particular individual therapists and nursing personnel, all under Dr. \nM's leader ship.

Dr M was con scious of confronting negative countertransference feelings \nnot only tow ard Sally but also toward her own team, vis-à-vis whom she fulfilled a \nsupervisory function. \n As an epilo gue to this dilemma it is of interest to note that after the discharge and \nupon renewin g the psychotherapy with Dr. M. on a priv ate basis, Sally although recovered \nfrom the set back in her nutritional status and eating behavior, became a very resistant patient \nwho eventual ly entered a negative therapeutic reaction which led to an insoluble impasse and \nultimately d iscontinuation of treatment. Sadly, Sally had a life long difficulty in retaining her \n\"good object s\". During the f ollowing years, Sally had several relapses which required \nhospitalizat ion in the same eating disorder setting, although without dilemmas with regard to \nthe identity of the therapist since Dr. M has in the mean time retired from the service. \n \nSupervisio n of Individual Psychotherapy of Patients with Eating Disorders \n The overall effectiveness of the various forms of psychotherapy in eating disorders \nremains cont roversial, the dropout rate is high and randomized controlled trials are extremely \nrare (17).

This concept g ained a new dimension half a century ago owing to \nSearles (20), Eckstein and Wallerstein (16) who introduced the notion of a parallel process, \nmeaning the in terwoven interaction between patient, analyst, and supervisor. \nRegarded from different perspectives, transference and counter-transference gained more \nattention and controversy than any other subject within the psychoanalytic domain. Until less \nth an three dec ades ago counter-transference in supervision was avoided rather than accepted \nand utilized. For most super visors the supervisee's counter-transference seemed to be a \nPandora's Box they feared to open, out of concern that they may, from their position of \nauthority, ina ppropriately intrude into the personality and inner life of the supervisee and turn \nsupervision in to psychotherapy. Over time, the initial trend of seeing these phenomena as \npathological p rocesses and impediments to therapy radically changed to considering \ntransference a nd counter-transference normal components of all conscious and unconscious \ninteractions.

Apparently, owing to her performance, she was very \nmuch appreciated by her superiors. \nRachel was very comm itted not only as a soldier but as patient as well. She was punctual, \nv erbal, associated f reely, unraveled memories, fantasized and remembered her dreams. Sadly \nthough, not o nly was there no improvement whatsoever in her anorexia, but gradually she \ndeveloped depressive symptoms: a sense of emptiness, purposelessness and lack of worth. In \nthe center of he r pr eoccupation was her parents' marital crisis, prompted by her father's extra \nmarital affair and h er sense of having been betrayed by him even more than her mother. \nThe military service was limited to office hours and Rachel slept at the family home. One \nnight, Rachel c alled the analyst at about two o'clock in the morning announcing that she had \ncut her wrists and w as bleeding profusely. To the analyst's que stion whether the parents are at \nhome, Rachel replied she believed they were asleep in their bedroom. The analyst wisely d id \nnot inquire why had Rachel called her on the phone rather than alert the parents down the \nhall, and instead pr ompted Rachel to immediately wake the parents up and rush to the \nemergency room. \nThe next day, for th e first time in the year and a half since the beginning of treatment, the \nanalyst received a p hone call from Rachel’s father, requesting a meeting. The analyst was \nanx ious to first mee t with Rachel following the suicide attempt, and also to hear from her how \nshe would feel about the proposed meeting with her parents. The analyst had prom ised to call \nthe father back. Giv en all options: t o oppose a meeting with parents, to accept and participate, \nor not participate, Rachel opted for the last. During that session, the analyst did ask the \nquestion:\" why did y ou call me first?\" Rachel couldn't find an answer and the analyst \ninterpreted the guil t and the incumbent self-punishment over an otherwise unconscious \nforbidden oedipal (o r primal scene) wish to penetrate the parent's bedroom. The meeting with \nth e parents proceede d smoothly, they expressed appropriate concern, were not intrusive but \nrather offended that Rachel chose to call a \"stranger\" for help, while they were available to \nher, next door. \nNow we come to super vision. The case was brought to an international forum of group \nsupervision held in Europe. The forum included e ight participants - associate members of the \nInternational Psycho analytic Association- led by a senior training analyst. Some participants \nw ere adamant about t he analyst meeting the parents, thus \"corrupting\" the neutrality of the \nanalytic process and turning it into an \"ordinary\" psychotherapy with parental guidance. They \nwould have opt ed for a different solution, such as referring the parents to a colleague for \nconsultation or poss ibly couple therapy. Other participants j oined the senior supervisor in \ncommenting on the sy mbolic significance of Rachel's \"cutting herself free\" from infantile ties \nand thus dismissing her parents from their protective parental role. \nThe analyst, althoug h appreciative of the different approaches and contributions, \nremained quite unset tled with regard to her so called \"transgression\" (meeting the parents). \nShe also felt that t he patient's message of loneliness had been somehow de-emphasized.

She left t he supe rvisi on session feeling rather confused but upon further reflection, had a \nsudden insight into a late projective identification vis-à-vis the patient (\"each of us was trying \nso hard and ultimately felt so utterly alone\") and on second thought, considered herself \nredeemed by the superv isory encounter. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBoth p sy chotherapy o f eating disorders and its corresponding supervision face issues \nbasically similar to a ny other therapy/supervision endeavor. Here too, the supervis or-\nsupervisee dyad faithf ully echoes the therapist –patient saga. However, there are som e unique \nfeatures inherent to e ating disorders pathology that merit emphasis. The main challenges \nf acing both the therap ist and the supervisor pertain to the psychotherapist’s ability to function \nas a member of a team; to focus on the therapy process rather than on symptoms but in a way \nthat balances therapeu tic neutrality with concern for the patient's vital medical needs; to cope \nwith issues of power s truggle and quest for control as they emerge in the parallel process. \nBoth the therapist and the supervisor may experience frustration, anger and narcissistic hurt \nvis-à-vis a resistant patient, unmotivated to change, and they are prone to a lessening of their \nsense of professional worth and personal value. This could be perceive d as role \nresponsiveness to the patient's unconscious malevolence. \nIn eating disorders as elsewhere, supervision is both an art and a métier. It could become \na uni que and memorable experience for a supervisory couple matched for personalities, \ntheoretical congruence and transference/counter-transference sagacity. But it can also take a less profitable course and lead to impasse. Quoting Schlesinger (3 5): \n\"There is art and scie nce in facilitating learning through supervision. How to describe \nsuper vision that facil itates learning? To paraphrase Hippocra tes, in the first place, it is \nimportant to do no har m.\" \nThe supervisory experi ence can be equally jeopardized by a supervisor's overly rigorous \nadherence to technique , too passive stance (which hampers learning), or activism and \nintrusiveness (which i mpair the supervisee's autonomy and creativity). \nSupervision of psychot herapy does not mean interfering with the treatment, or outdoing \nthe supervisee in his task. It is about being \"the re\" and \"with\", but not \"instead\" of the \ntherapist. As Winnicot t (29) wrot e: \n\"Responsible persons m ust be available when children play; but this does not mean that \nthe responsible person need enter into the children's playing\" \nDYNAMICS AN \n \n \nREFER ENCE \n \n[1] F ic ht er M.

Chapter 12 A TWELVE-STEP DAY TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH EATING DISORDERS: EXAMINING TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH BENEFITS Jennifer A. Boisvert 1 * , and W. Andrew Harrell 2 1 Independent Practice, Beverly Hills, CA, US 2 Professor Emeritus, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada ABSTRACT Increasingly, women are entering residential and day treatment programs for eating disorders. Little is known about women who seek this type of treatment alternative. Virtually no research has evaluated the effectiveness of a 12-step approach in a day treatment program for women with eating disorders, particularly the perception of treatment effectiveness from the patient’s perspective. In this chapter, we review the literature on residential and day treatment program effectiveness, emphasizing the patient’s perspective of treatment experiences and satisfaction, and 12-step programs for eating disorders. We also present data from an extensive interview-based survey of patient characteristics and perceptions of treatment effectiveness and satisfaction in a day program for eating disorders using a 12-step approach in Canada. In our analysis, we explored factors that were predictive of the success of patients in this treatment program, particularly the manner in which treatment goals were set, whether or not they were attained, whether these goals could be maintained after discharge from treatment, whether there were relapses, and the intensity of these relapses. In particular, we identified unique problems facing anorexia nervosa patients and how this treatment program enabled them to cope with and overcome relapse. There is strong evidence that this program was successful in treating a range of eating disordered women, particularly those with anorexia nervosa, with much of its success likely due to the strong social connections developed during treatment—something inherent in the 12-step model and often lacking in medically-oriented treatments. * Corresponding author; E-mail: jenniferboisvert@hotmail.com. 2016.

IN TRODUCTION Ov erview Re search on the treatment of clinical eating disorders of anorexia nervosa and bulimia \nne rvosa rarely focuses on 12-step programs. Vi rtually no research to date has evaluated the \nef fectiveness of a 12-step approach in a residential or day treatment program for women with \ncl inical eating disorders, nor is there any indication of the type of patient who can benefit \nmo st from this approach. \nWe begin by providing a definition of and background information on eating disorders, \nfo llowed by a review of the literature on 12-step programs for eating disorders and what is \nkn own to date about their incorporation into residential or day treatment programs. Th is \nli terature also addresses the patient’s perspective of treatment experiences and satisfaction \nan d the therapeutic value of spirituality in the context of 12-step programs. In our review of \n12 -step programs, we will show how the concept of spirituality—a concept not fully \nex amined in the eating disorder literature—should be integrated into our understanding of and \ntr eatment of women with eating disorders. \nFi nally, we will present findings from our research program evaluating a day treatment \npr ogram for eating disorders based on a 12-step program, and discuss how a 12-step program \nca n enhance both treatment and recovery processes. We hope that this chapter will advance \nth e conceptual and empirical refinement of research, thereby contributing to more effective \ncl inical practice. We conclude by offering recommendations for further research and practice. EA TING DISORDERS As defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5: APA, \n20 13), clinical eating disorders are mental disorders characterized by extreme disturbances of \nea ting behavior. An orexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are diagnostic \nca tegories of eating disorders with distinct criteria (APA, 2013; Fairburn & Harrison, 2003; \nfo r reviews, see Klein & Walsh, 2004; Williamson, Martin, & Stewart, 2004).

Atyp ical eating \ndiso rders—other feeding or eating disorder, unspecified feeding or eating disorder (DSM-5: \nAPA, 2013), or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)—also comprise a \ndiag nostic category (DSM-IV-TR: APA, 2000) (Fairburn & Harrison, 2003; Rockert, Kaplan, \n& Ol msted, 2007). \nEati ng disorders are recognized as multi-dimensional, complex and chronic illnesses, \nwith biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contributing to their development and \ncour se in different ways for different individuals (Boisvert, 2006, 2012; Boisvert & Harrell, \n2009 a, 2009b, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c, 2013d, 2014a, 2014b, 2015; Fairburn, Cooper, Shafran, \n& Wi lson, 2008; Fairburn & Harrison, 2003; Klein & Walsh, 2004).

Rese arch also suggests \nthat spirituality and/or religiosity, too, may influence the onset of eating disorder symptoms \nand how patients might benefit from incorporation of a spiritual focus in treatment (Boisvert, \n2006 ; Boisvert & Harrell, 2012, 2013a, 2015, 2016). The extent to which these multi-\ndime nsional factors interact is not well understood (Fairburn & Harrison, 2003; Klein & \nWals h, 2004). Desp ite the complexity of eating disorders, a recurrent finding in this research \nis t hat being female is consistently identified as a “fixed risk factor” and “lived experience” of \npati ents (Murnen & Smolak, 2015; Smolak & Murnen, 2001). Thus , Striegel-Moore and \nBuli k (2007) observed: “The single best predictor of risk for developing an eating disorder is \nbein g female, prompting the question why women?” (p. 182) . \nEati ng disorders disproportionately affect women, with lifetime prevalence as high as 3:1 \nas c ompared to its prevalence in men (Fairburn & Harrison, 2003; Hoek, 2006; Hudson, \nHiri pi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007). Stud ies of gender differences in prevalence of eating disorder \nsymp toms show women are significantly more affected than men, though some men also \nrepo rt these symptoms (e.g., Lewinsohn, Seeley, Moerk, & Striegel-Moore, 2002; Striegel-\nMoor e et al., 2009). Othe r research has also documented eating disorder symptoms in men \n(e.g ., Boisvert & Harrell, 2009b, 2009c, 2012). Life time prevalence estimates of anorexia \nnerv osa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are 0.9%, 1.5% and 3.5% among women, \nand 0.3%, 0.5% and 2.0% among men (Hudson et al., 2007). Howe ver, higher estimates have \nbeen found in women across the eating disorder spectrum, including a 4.7% lifetime \nprev alence of atypical eating disorders (Favaro, Ferrara, & Santonastaso, 2003). For anorexia \nnerv osa and bulimia nervosa, average prevalence rates of 0.3% and 1.0%, respectively, have \nbeen found for young women (Hoek, 2006). \nEati ng disorders are the third most common form of chronic illness among adolescent \nand young adult women in the United States (Gordon, 2000). Chro nicity of illness often leads \nto r elapse, recurrence and poor outcome; the unremitting nature of these disorders makes \nthem treatment refractory (Keller, Herzog, Lavori, Bradburn, & Mahoney, 1992; Olmsted, \nKapl an, & Rockert, 1994; Pike, 1998; Steinhausen, 2002; Steinhausen & Weber, 2009; \nSull ivan, 2001). Eati ng disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa, have the highest mortality \nrate s of any psychiatric diagnosis (Arcelus, Mitchell, Wales, & Nielsen, 2011; Herzog et al., \n2000 ; Hoek, 2006; Sullivan, 1995). \nEati ng disorders, recognized as a substantial disease burden (Agras, 2001; Hay & Mond, \n2005 ), are linked to substantial psychological, social and physiological disturbances, and \nmedi cal complications (Klein & Walsh, 2004; Rome & Ammerman, 2003; Williamson et al., \n2004 ; Zipfel, Löwe, & Herzog, 2003).

Method s used to avoid or \npreven t weight gain can include starvation, excessive exercising and purging, such as \nvomiti ng or laxative abuse (Peñas-Lledó, Vaz Leal, & Waller, 2002; Turner, Batik, Palmer, \nForbes , & McDermott, 2000). Medica l complications can include amenorrhea, lethargy, \nbradyc ardia, peripheral edema, impaired renal function, cardiovascular problems, and \nosteop erosis (Athey, 2003; Mitchell & Crow, 2006; for review, see Katzman, 2005). \nCompli cations are typically fatal, with a substantial risk of death from starvation or suicide \n(Herzo g et al., 2000; Hoek, 2006). Patien t’s receptivity to treatment is frequently poor, and \nmany o f them seek treatment only when emaciated to the point of death (Abbate-Daga, \nAmiant o, Delsedime, De-Bacco, & Fassino, 2013). Women with anorexia nervosa, especially \nthose with binge-purge behavior, longer illness history and lower body mass index (BMI), \ntend t o fail to engage in or drop-out of treatment prematurely, possibly out of a sense of \nhopele ssness about existing treatment models (Abbate-Daga et al., 2015; Howard, Evans, \nQuinte ro-Howard, Bowers, & Andersen, 1999; Löwe et al., 2001; for reviews, see Fassino, \nPierò, Tomba, & Abbate-Daga, 2009; Mahon, 2000). \nBulimi a nervosa (BN) also involves preoccupation with food and is characterized by \nbinge eating followed by purging, excessive exercise or fasting (APA, 2013). Lifeti me \npreval ence rates range from 0.9% to 2.9% (Hoek & van Hoeken, 2003; Smink et al., 2012). \nMedica l complications can include loss of dental enamel, cardiac and skeletal myopathies, \namenor rhea, and electrolyte imbalances (Lasater & Mehler, 2001; Mehler, 2011; Mitchell & \nCrow, 2006). Fatal medical complications can occur in the form of esophageal tears, gastric \nruptur e and cardiac arrhythmias (Lasater & Mehler, 2001; Mehler, 2011; Mitchell & Crow, \n2006). Women with bulimia nervosa report considerable disability, impairment, distress, and \nco-occ urring illnesses compared to women without bulimia nervosa (Johnson, Spitzer, & \nWillia ms, 2001). Women with bulimia nervosa who report a longer illness history and higher \nlevels of laxative abuse, depressed mood and anger, and dissatisfaction with their body \nweight , typically fail to engage in treatment or drop-out prematurely (Agras et al., 2000; \nCoker, Vize, Wade, & Cooper, 1993; Fassino, Abbate-Daga, Pierò, Leombruni, & Rovera, \n2003; for reviews, see Bell, 2001; Fassino et al., 2009; Mahon, 2000). \nBinge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent binge eating in the absence of \nextrem","section":"p4"}

Patients with \nbinge ea ting disorder report higher levels of disability, medical problems, anxiety and mood \ndisorder s, and psychosocial stress compared to women without binge eating disorder \n(Fassino , Leombruni, Pierò, Abbate-Daga, & Rovera, 2003; Johnson et al., 2001; Wilfley et \nal., 200 3).

Treatment interventions for patients with eating disorders have \ntypically been offered on an outpatient or inpatient basis, but in recent decades this has shifted \nwith the r ise of residential and day treatment programs (Birchall, Palmer, Waine, Gadsby & \nGatward, 2 002; Frisch, Herzog, & Franko, 2006; Lammers, Exterkate, & De Jong, 2007; \nWillinge e t al., 2010; Zipfel et al., 2002). A variety of multi-disciplinary, group-treatment \nfocused re sidential and day treatment programs have been developed as part of a larger model \nor continu um of care for eating disorder patients in different countries and healthcare settings \n(e.g., Kay e, Kaplan, & Zucker, 1996; Robinson, 1993, 2003; Willinge et al., 2010; for \nreviews, s ee Abbate-Daga et al., 2009; Frisch et al., 2006; Lammers et al., 2007; Zipfel et al., \n2002). The se prog rams, which are subject to ongoing structural and treatment model changes \nin respons e to managed care forces and patient needs, vary in terms of breadth and intensity \nof treatme nt and size. Wthin the stepped-care framework, they facilitate a step-down \ntransition from inpatient care or step-up transition from outpatient care. \nDay treatm ent programs were originally designed for cost-containment, involving \nbiological , psychological and social interventions aligned with therapeutic goals of medical \nstabilizat ion and the normalization of eating and related behaviors. These day treatment \nprograms h ave sought to improve health status along with psychological and social \nfunctionin g (Kaye et al., 1996; Piran, Langdon, Kaplan, & Garfinkel, 1989; Piran, Kaplan, et \nal., 1989) . Residentia l treatment programs were similarly established to provide cost-effective \n24-hour/7- day-a-week intensive and comprehensive services such as individual, group and \nfamily the rapy as well as medical and nutritional stabilization. Residentia l treatment is an \nintensive modality, entailing biological, psychological and social interventions and preventing \nphysical d eterioration or death (Frisch et al., 2006). Residentia l and day treatment programs \nare equipp ed to address dual-diagnoses. Women with eating disorders often have co-morbid \nsubstance use disorders (Blinder, Cumella, & Sanathara, 2006; Walfish, Stenmark, Sarco, \nShealy, & Krone, 1992; for review, see Holderness, Brooks-Gunn, & Warren, 1994).

Residential and \nday treatmen t programs have the advantage of a long-term, structured and intensive treatment \nlocale outsi de the sterile environment of a hospital setting. They are gen erally cheaper than \ninpatient tr eatment (Piran, Kaplan, et al., 1989; Striegel-Moore, Leslie, Petrill, Garvin, & \nRosenheck, 2 000). The average cost per day ($956) recently reported for residential treatment \nversus the c ost of one day ($2000) in inpatient treatment indicates that residential treatment is \na more cost- effective option for both short- and long-term care (Frisch et al., 2006). Whereas \nthe average weekly costs of inpatient treatment can total $3722.00, the average cost of a day \ntreatment pr ogram is estimated at $804.00 (Kaplan & Olmsted, 1997). Day treatmen t reduces \ncosts by one -third compared to inpatient programs (Howard et al., 1999), with costs as low as \n$9645.00 per patient and treatment (Williamson, Thaw, & Varnando-Sullivan, 2001). \n \nTreatment Ef fectiveness \nMuch of the literature on residential and day treatment programs offers a summary of the \nprograms, bu t it reports no detailed supporting documentation or empirical data (e.g., \nGerlinghoff, Gross, & Backmund, 2003; Johnson & Sansone, 1993; Johnson & Taylor, 1996; \nRichards, Ha rdman, & Berrett, 2007; Stewart & Williamson, 2004a, 2004b; Thornton, \nBeumont, Tou yz, 2002; Touyz, Thornton, Rieger, George, & Beumont, 2003). While \nresid ential and day treatment options for women with eating disorders have become more \navailable in the last few decades due to their clinical and cost advantages, very few studies \nactually exa mine program effectiveness and outcomes (for reviews, see Abbate-Daga et al., \n2009; Frisch et al., 2006; Hepburn & Wilson, 2014; Lammers et al., 2007; Zipfel et al., 2002). \nZipfel et al . (2002) conducted a systematic literature search that was limited to three day \ntreatment pr ograms. Both similar ities (e.g., use of a multi-disciplinary staff, reliance on group \ntreatment as the primary means of therapy), and marked differences (e.g., inclusion criteria, \nintensity of care) were found. \nLammers et a l. (2007), in an attempt to compare their treatment program with others, \nconducted a systematic literature search that was limited to seven day treatment programs. \nThere were s imilarities between all of the programs (e.g., inclusion criteria, intended \noutcome, spe cific treatment interventions). However, man y important differences also existed \n(e.g., treat ment duration, intensity of treatment, theoretical orientation, goals of treatment, and \nweight gain regime). Lammers et a l.

(2009) conducted a literature review of 11 day treatments for eating \ndisorders to e xamine similarities, differences and treatment goals across programs, including \ntheir own prog ram. The main simil arities were as follows: A biopsychosocial model served as \na frame of ref erence. A CBT model wa s the basis for treatment, with behavioral contracts \nbeing featured . Other objectiv es included weight normalization/weight gain, and eating \nbehavior modif ication/normalization. Family involve ment was often integrated into the \ntreatment proc edure, with attention given to body image modification. The main diffe rences \nwere a lack of inclusion criteria, treatment duration, approach to eating and compensatory \nbehaviors rang ed from control to autonomy, psychometric assessment, and varying degrees of \npost-discharge follow-up. Psychological and behavioral objectives also differed. The review \nsu ggested the existence of two different day treatment models. The first has a shorter duration \nprogram which is mainly symptom-focused. The second is more individual-focused, of longer \nduration, with an emphasis on patient’s relational skills, psychodynamic understanding of \nsymptoms, and gradual changes in body weight. \nHepburn and Wi lson (2014) conducted a systematic review of pre- and post-outcomes \nfrom 15 studie s assessing the effectiveness of day treatment programs for adults with eating \ndisorders. Fin dings revea led mainly large and medium effect sizes. Large effect s izes \nincluded incre ases in BMI for patients with anorexia nervosa and reduction in symptoms, and \na decrease in depression. Medium effect sizes were changes in self-esteem and reduction in \nanxiety. Mediu m to larg e effect sizes were also found for eating disorder attitude change. One \nexception was for perfectionism which showed only a small effect size. \nTurning from l iterature reviews to individual studies, the research evaluating the \neffectiveness of residential treatment in samples of eating disordered adults mostly reports \ngood short- an d long-term outcomes (Bean et al., 2008; Bean & Weltzin, 2001; Brewerton & \nCostin, 2011a, 2011b; Delinksy et al., 2010; Gleaves, Post, Eberenz, & Davis, 1993; Lowe et \nal., 2003; Woo ley, Wooley, & Deddens, 1993).

Some st udies i ndicate that post-discharge, patients who are encouraged to participate \nin self-help g roups tend to maintain good outcomes (e.g., Fittig et al., 2008; Gerlinghoff et al., \n1998). \nCompar isons ac ross day treatment programs where eating disorder patients are treated in \nhomogeneous gr oups have shown many similarities, e.g., CBT orientation, but also important \ndifferences in terms of treatment goals and outcomes (Gerlinghoff et al., 1998; Levitt & \n EBSCOhost: eB ook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:17:39 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Sobriety \nis similarly understoo d in a spiritual context, involving far more than being abstinent...[it is] \nhaving to do with a sp iritual maturity that involves acceptance, humility and serenity” (p. \n981). The text, Alcoho lics A nonymous (AA) (the “Big Book”: AA World Services, 1939), \nconceptualizes the AA program while its companion text, Twelve Steps and Twelve \nTraditions (AA World S ervices, 1952) elaborates on the 12-step philosophy and the \nspiritually-grounded e thos of mutual support as a health benefit. Twelve-step groups pro vide \naccessible group suppo rt while addressing individuals’ needs for identity, integrity and an \ninner life within a sp iritual context (Peteet, 1993). Twelve-step groups are truly one of the \nfew places in contempo rary life where people can be “real” in honestly sharing their \nweaknesses, failings, character defects, imperfections, and hence, humanness (Khantzian & \nMack, 1994; Kurtz & Ke tchum, 1992). \nAs a “spiritual recove ry movement,” 12-step programs engage its followers in behavioral \nexpectations associate d with their health issues (Galanter, 2007).

Spirituality can \nbe d efined as “the fee lings, thoughts, experiences, and behaviors that arise from a search for \nthe sacred” (Hill et a l., 2000, p. 66; Hill & Pargament, 2003; Pargament, 2001; Pargament, \nMahoney, Exline, Jones , & Shafranske, 2013).

The first st ep of OA beg ins with the admission of powerlessness over food; the \nnext eleven steps are de signed to help members achieve “physical, emotional and spiritual \nhealing” (OA, 1990). The only requirement for membership is the desire to stop eating \ncompulsively (OA, 1990). OA members report a rang e of dysfunctional eating patterns and \ndifficulties with food ( Russell-Mayhew et al., 2010; von Ranson et al., 2011). \nThe goal of OA is abstin ence from food, although the definition of abstinence may be \ndifferent for each membe r (Russell-Mayhew et al., 2010). It may involve abstinenc e from \nparticular foods, i.e., white flour, sugar, or abstinence from overeating or binge eating. Given \nthe impossibility of abs taining entirely from food, OA encourages the use of a food plan in \naddition to the 12-steps to help members achieve recovery. OA does not outline the food plan \nthat should be adopted—t his is left up to individual members.

The 12-step component invo lved patients spending \napproximately one hour per day on 12-step-oriented material such as step studies, meditations \nand reading the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) text aka the “Big Book,” The Twelve Steps and \nTwelve Traditions and othe r AA-related texts. Twelve-step groups led by recovering \ncounselors closed with a s erenity prayer, a 12-step tradition. Patients were also encoura ged to \nattend 12-step meetings in the community. Some of the advantages of the 12-step component \ndescribed by Johnson and S ansone (1993) and Johnson and Taylor (1996) include \nengendering hope and faith (e.g., “Do what I have done and you will get better”), and offering \nstructure, a common langua ge, and a support network. \nRichards et al. (2007) rep orted on their experience of including a 12-step group in multi-\nmodal inpatient and reside ntial treatment programs for eating disorders. Patients in their \nprogram s attended a weekly one hour 12-step group led by a psychotherapist who encouraged \n“a personal, spiritual jou rney toward recovery” by getting “in touch with their spirituality” \nand opening up to the “exp erience of how God acts in the group, their own life, and their \npeers’ lives” (Richards et al., 2007, p. 190). Richards et al. (200 7) con cluded that there are \nmany potential benefits of using a 12-step group in inpatient and residential treatments and \nthese may extend to outpat ient treatment, too. \nRichards et al. (2007) con cluded: “First and foremost, a 12-step group provides a tried \nand tested method for incl uding spirituality in treatment. The 12-step approach is ec umenical \nand thus allows patients f rom diverse religious and spiritual backgrounds to come together in \nan accepting atmosphere wh ere they can support each other in their spiritual exploration and \ngrowth. The 12-step approa ch also offers a number of other potential benefits, including (a) \ninstillation of hope and f aith for recovery, (b) giving women a common language for \ndiscussing spirituality, ( c) providing a concrete action plan for using one’s faith in recovery, \nand (d) offering a support network that can help prevent relapse, particularly after \nprofessional treatment has ended...” (p. 203). \nTaking it a step fu rther, Richards, Berrett, Hardman, and Eggett (2006) examined the \npotential benefits of spir ituality and effectiveness of using spirituality-oriented approaches in \n EBSCOhost: eBook Collecti on (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:17:39 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

(2006) compa red the effectiveness of \na spiritually-oriented appro ach with cognitive and emotional approaches among eating \ndisordered women (N = 122) r eceiving residential treatment. Results showed that at the conclusion of treatment, pat ients in the spirituality support group reported significantly fewer \neating disorder symptoms and psychological disturbance and greater spiritual well-being \ncompared to patients in the other groups. Richards et al. (2006) concl uded: “...[A]ttending to \neating disord er patients’ sp iritual growth and well-being during inpatient treatment may help \nreduce depression and anxiet y, relationship distress, social role conflict, and eating disorder \nsymptoms” (p. 401). \n \nNew R esearch on a T welve-S te p Day Treatment Program for Women with \nEating Disorders \nIn this se ction of our chapt er, we report findings from research that evaluates the \neffectiveness of a day treat ment program for eating disorders—its predominant use of a 12-\nstep model, which emphasizes spirituality—in a clinical sample of Canadian women (N = 22). \nSince relatively few women s eek treatment at specialized facilities it is essential that we \nincrease our knowledge of pa tient characteristics and perspectives of treatment effectiveness \nand satisfaction. Moreover, it is critical tha t we gain insight and understanding of the clinical \nutility of incorporating a 1 2-step approach and spiritual strategies into specialized facilities, as \nthere is virtually no publis hed data. Accordingly, the present stu dy was designed to fill a gap \nin the literature. An unders tanding of the use of a 12-step approach and its spiritual \ncomponent can help professio nals in their efforts to treat effectively eating disorders and \npromote recovery processes. Implications for practice an d research are discussed, contributing \nto the dialogue on treatment options for eating disorders. \nThis study differed from pre vious research by: (1) examining patient characteristics in the \ncontext of a day treatment p rogram for eating disorders using a 12-step approach, (2) \nexamining the patient’s pers pective on this treatment model, notably effectiveness and \nsatisfaction, and (3) examin ing spirituality, e.g., spiritual health benefits, of this treatment \nmodel. \n \n \nMETHOD \n \nTreatm ent Sett in g The w om en in this study re ce ived treatment for an eating disorder at the Society for the \nAssisted Cooperative Recover y from Eating Disorders (SACRED), a non-profit treatment \nprogram located in Alberta, Canada.

It was also believed that the 12-steps could promote self-\ndiscovery, enhance self-esteem and self-empowerment, foster a sense of autonomy alongside \nconnectivity, and assist in de veloping a healthy, balanced lifestyle and quality of life. \nMeal support was a core compon ent of the program, with patients eating together to \nencourage one another to let g o of their control vis-à-vis food and instead surrender to it. This \nhallmark feature of SACR ED was aligned with the ABA framework (ABA, 2002). A unique, \nkey component of SA CRED’s Day Program was the use of recovered staff on the treatment \nteam—staff that had recovered via a 12-step program, e.g., ABA, AA. It was believed that \nhaving r ecovered staff working in a residential/day treatment program also eating the same \nfood and sitting with patients helped them to develop behavioral patterns leading to recovery. \nIn addition to exposure to and hands-on experiences with food to simulate real life, it was \nbelieved that eating meals wit h recovered staff enabled patients to observe role modeling of \nhealthy eating and to surrende r control over eating. This unique therapeutic practi ce, i.e., \nusing staff members who had “d one it themselves and recovered from the 12-steps” and thus, \ncould draw on personal experie nce to help eating disordered women through the ABA 12-step \nprogram, has not been previous ly reported in the literature. Recovered staff members, refer red \nto as “primary workers,” were expected to self-disclose of their experience of 12-step \nrecovery and in this way, serv e as role models of recovery. Some primary workers were also social workers who possessed t he therapeutic skills necessary to lead various therapies (e.g., \nindividual, group, family/coup les), and facilitate patients’ therapeutic processes. \n Patients were admitted to SAC RED following referrals from sources such as medical \nprofessionals, hospitals and c ommunity self-help groups, e.g., 12-step groups. SACRED \ntreated women diagnose d with a norexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder (i.e., \ncompulsive overeating), as wel l as atypical eating disorders. Eligibility for admission requ ired \nthat patients passed a physica l exam by a physician as well as an intake with the program \nmanager. Admission was a colla borative process between the admitting patient and treatment \nteam members. The duration of each woman’s s tay varied based on her personal \ncircumstances and treatment ne eds.

Thus, the strong association in Table 1 \nbetween BMI and attainment of treatment goals at SAC RED and the maintenance of \ntreatment goals upon discharge reflects a confounded relationship between AN and low BMI. \nThose respondents with an AN diagnosis tended to rep ort lower BMI values, and, in turn, \nwere less likely to report achieving treatment goals at SACRED or to maintain these goals \nafter discharge. \nThree indicators of relapse from t reatment were obta ined from the survey responses. The \nfirst asked respondents whether they had relaps ed fr om the treatment they received at \nSACRED, with a 1 assigned to a “yes” response and 2 to a “no.” The second asked them how \nmany times they had relap sed since being discharged from SACRED, and the third asked \nthem the average length of these relapses. Table 1 i ndicates a significant positive relationshi p \nbetween weight discrepancy and whether or not the re spondent reported a relapse; i.e., the \ngreater the discrepancy between a respondent’s actua l weight and desired or ideal weight, the \nless likely they were to indicate that they had rela psed. That is, respondents with a smaller \ngap between act ual and ideal weight were more likely to relapse. Again, we find that \nrespondents with an AN diagnosi s were responsible fo r this association. These respondents \ntended to have a significantly sm aller actual to ide al weight discrepancy (M = 25.71, SD = \n31.68) versus those patients with another diagnosis (M = 90.55, SD = 65.69; t = 2.37, p < .05). \nThe negative correlation between an AN diagnosis and weight discrepancy (r = -0.57, p < \n.05) suggests that these respondents confounded the relationship between relapse and weight \ndiscrepancy. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents without an AN diagnosis reported that \nthey had not relapsed after discharge, versus only 2 8.6% of respondents with an AN diagnosis \nreported that they had not relapsed (χ = 1.71, p = 0 .19).

This study is important as it gives a prelimin ary snapsh ot of the usefulness of a 12-\nstep approach in specialized treatment for women across the eating disorder spectrum. Since \nSACRED was based on a nontraditional way of think ing abo ut the treatment of eating \ndisorders, placing the responsibility for sustained chan ge on the patient’s shoulders, we \nbelieve that it is important to evaluate this kind of pr ogram from the patient’s perspective via \nsubjective self-reports rather than with traditional obj ective measures. Thus, measuring \nrecovery/sobriety and spirituality, e.g ., spiritual heal th outcomes, in addition to physical, \npsychological and social health outcomes would be both a ppropriate and expected. We \nrecognize that objective measures may have complimen ted and augmented our findings. For \nexample, it would be of interest to use objective m easur es such as the Spiritual Well-Being \nScale (SWBS: Paloutzian & Ellison, 1982) or the Spiritua lity Self-Rating Scale (SSRS: \nGalanter et al., 2007 to illuminate better the spiritual health benefits of a 12-step treatment \nmodel and how patient’s experience of spirituality might change with recovery. \nThe literature in this area suggests a 12-step approach has the potential to enhance \nresidential and day treatment programs for eating disord ers (e.g., Johnson & Sansone, 1993; \n EBSCOhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/2 6/2025 10:17:39 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Quite possibly, women with lower hope a nd/or more severe e ating \ndisorder symptomatology might benefit from the incorporati on of an ABA 12-step approach \nin residential/day treatment settings such as that used by SACRED. \nMore research is needed to evaluate if 12-step programs fo r eating disorders, e.g., ABA, \nOA, are appropriate interventions for those with less seve re symptoms as well as those with \nmore severe symptoms consonant with level of care, e.g., r esidential/day treatment setting. In \naddition to evaluating the clinical utility of ABA and OA in reducing eating disorder \nsymptoms, there is a need to identify more precisely when these 12-step programs might be \nmost suitable or contraindicated across the eating disorde r spectrum. \nAddressing spiritual issues and applying spirituality-orie nted interventions to clinical \neating disorders may also enhance treatment outcomes (Berr ett, Hardman, & Richards, 2010; \nHardman, Berrett, & Richards, 2003, 2004; Richards et al., 1997, 2006; Smith, Bartz, & \nRichards, 2007; Smith, Hardman, Richards, & Fischer, 2003) . Clinicians should consider the \npotential benefits of inco rporating spiritual elements int o treatment while remaining \nrespectful of patients’ beliefs. They also might address s piritual issues or matters in cas e \nformulation and treatment plans (Dell & Josephson, 2007). Failure to do so may be a missed \nopportunity to promote t he patient’s vision of self (Jersl id, 2001), personal growth and \nholism. \nRichards et al. (1997) have offered suggestions i n this re gard, including: teaching \nspiritual concepts, religious bibliotherapy, prayer, spiri tual imagery or meditation, \nencouraging forgiveness, referral for spiritual/religious direction, and involvement in the \nreligious community. A clinician who chooses to teach spir ituality should focus on those \nparticular aspects that counteract harmful secular cultura l values that emphasize unattainable \nthinness goals. At this point in time, research has not li nked specific fe atures of spiritual well-\nbeing with healthy attitudes towards body satisfaction and acceptance. Richard et al.’s (1997) \nsuggestions may encourage healthy spiritual development, t hereby preventing women from \nbecoming at-risk. Adjunct interventions with a spiritual h ealth component th at encourages \npatients to commune with nature, animals, e.g., dog-walkin g, and the universe (see Boisvert \n& Harrell, 2014c, 2015) might augment traditional and nont raditional interventions (Madden, \nFogarty, & Smith, 2014). In addition to promoting spiritua l health, the human-anima l bond \ncan complement 12-step programs with their emphasis on str ong social ties.

Spirituality is not routinely considered nor ass essed in eat ing disorder program \nevaluation studies, seriously limiting our understanding of comprehensive and holistic \ntreatment and care. Spirituality in the context of a 12-step program such as SAC RED may \npromote an attitude or mindset that facilitates some patient s’ openness and readiness to \nchange. It may be influential in a patient’s choice of a giv en treat ment program or in \npromoting adherence to the program’s behavioral expectations , e.g., compliance with food \nplan. It may also be influential in a patient’s short- and l ong-te rm engagement in 12-step \nprograms or groups, serving as a vehicle for sustaining shor t- and long-term recovery. \nFurther investigation is needed into the role played by spir ituality in relation to readiness \nfor change at the time of admission to residential treatment (McHugh, 2007) or maintenance \nof change following discharge from residential treatment (Co ckelle, Zaitsoff, & Geller, 2004). \nSpiritual dimensions in recovery (Matusek & Knudson, 2009) a nd stage of change processes \npre- and post-treatment and in recovery might also be of int erest (Keski-Rahkonen & Tozzi, \n2005; Touyz et al., 2003). Qualitative studies of maintenanc e of change following resid ential \ntreatment have also emphasized the role of social support, r evealing that speaking with \nsomeone who recovered is a crucial factor in eating disorder ed women’s recovery (e.g., \nCockell et al., 2004). Positive, peer-driven support may pro ve to be critical to an eating \ndisordered women’s recovery in a residential or day treatmen t setting. While a few studies of \nresidential treatment programs have casually commented on th e use of recovered staff as a \nkey component of treatment (e.g., Brewerton & Costin, 2011a, 2011b; Johnson & Sansone, \n1993; Johnson & Taylor, 1996), it has not been explored in t he context of a ABA 12-step \ntreatment model like that of SACRED. \nWhile research on spir ituality in women with eating disorder symptomatology is growing \n(Boisvert, 2006; Boisvert & Harrell, 2012, 2013a, 2015, 2016 ), more clarity is needed on how \nwomen with clinical eating disorders experience it in treatm ent settings incorporating a 12-\nstep approach. Many of the women we studied ascribed importa nce to it in th eir treatment and \nhence, achieving of spiritual health benefits. Chappel and D uPont (1999) have asserted: “The \ngreat strengt h of 12-step programs is that they allow each m ember to have whatever spiritual \nexperience they can attain, including none at all” (p. 442).

Further study i s needed to dete rmine whether ea ting disordered women can benefit \nequally by a 12-step abbreviated day treatment program versus a 12-step intensive residential \ntreatment program. \nClinicians should consider integrating 12- step programs into t raditional interventions and \nbe comfortable with the spiritual dimensions of treatment and recovery from addictive \nbehaviors (Chappel & DuPont, 1999; Detar, 2011; Galanter, 2005 , 2007; Khantzian & Mack, \n1994; Kurtz, 1997; Kurtz & Ketchum, 1992; Schenker, 2009), inc luding eating disorder \nbehaviors. Clinicians often report referring their eating diso rdered pati ents to 12-step groups \nin the community such as OA for adjunct treatment (von Ranson, Wallace, & Stevenson, \n2013). Clinicians need to recognize the therapeutic value of 1 2-step programs goes well \nbeyond adjunct treatment, and that referring eating disordered patients to residential/day \ntreatment programs based on a 12-step philosophy has many adva ntages. Our study suggests \nimportant health benefits, notably spiritu al, of patients ente ring an ABA 12-step program such \nas SACRED in seeking treatment for a wide range of eating diso rders, particularly anorexia \nnervosa.

As with our study, a \ncommon methodological limitation of studie s on treatment effecti veness and outcomes in \neating disordered adults is that they are characterized by small sample sizes (for examples, \nsee Ben-Porath et al., 2010; Birchall et al., 2002; Freeman, 199 2; Howard et al., 1999). \nLongitudinal studies using larger samples of women may afford th e best opportunity to \nevaluate the treatment effectiveness of ABA 12-step programs in residential/day treatment \nsettings for eating disorders. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAbbate-Daga, G ., Amianto, F., Delsedime, N., D e- Ba cco, C., & F as sino, S.

Fornari Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York, US ABSTRACT This chapter, on specialized Day Treatment for Eating Disorders, will examine an intensive therapeutic alternative to inpatient hospital care for children and adolescents with atypical anorexia nervosa and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Day treatment programs (DTPs) are unique, comprehensive psychiatric care that employ a multi-disciplinary team to care for the patients and utilize various forms of group psychotherapy throughout the day, providing structured, supervised meals, as well as close psychiatric and medical monitoring. This chapter will review strategies to treat both ARFID and atypical anorexia nervosa in DTP settings. Two case vignettes will highlight the challenges of caring for these complex and life threatening disorders in children and adolescents. Family-based informed treatment and family meals will be described as an integral part of the structure of the treatment. Clinical experience and wisdom will determine the limits of DTP for children and adolescents with more serious medical and psychiatric disorders who require a higher level of care. Future clinical research is needed to appreciate the most effective treatment approaches and strategies for the successful outcome for youth with ARFID and atypical anorexia nervosa.

AR FID blurs the distinction between feeding and \nea ting disorders. Th ere is no longer a distinction between the two in DSM-5 (i.e., in DSM-IV \nfe eding disorders included Pica, Rumination d/o, and FDIEC, whereas eating disorders \nin cluded Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and Eating Disorder not otherwise \nsp ecified (EDNOS). AR FID is a combination of some feeding and some eating disorders \n(U her & Rutter, 2012), in that it includes some previously diagnosed with eating disorders \nsu ch as EDNOS in DSM-IV (i.e., those with FAED, Food Avoidance Emotional Disorder), as \nwe ll as those who previously received the feeding disorder diagnosis of FDIEC (Bryant-\nWa ugh, 2013).

Th e Evolution of ARFID Th e ED criteria in DSM-IV did not adequately capture these diagnoses in children and \nad olescents, who often possess different levels of chronicity and capacity for thinking \nco mpared to adults and often possess feeding issues rooted in developmental issues. As a \nre sult, up to 90% of children and adolescents in community samples received a diagnosis of \nED NOS (Zimmerman et al., 2008), a heterogeneous group which described little about the \nac tual ED diagnosis. Ch ildren in this category were often forgotten about, improperly \nmo nitored, left without insurance coverage for treatment or accepted into programs with \nli mited spots reserved only for those with AN/BN. Of ten these children and adolescents in the \nED NOS category were simply observed until they became sicker with full-blown symptoms \nof an ED. Gi ven the heterogeneity of the EDNOS groups, it was also difficult to target \nre search and treatment for this group. AR FID was created to help better define some of those \nin the EDNOS category and provide them a more accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment \n(F isher et al., 2014). \nFu rthermore, there were numerous concerns with the previous FDIEC diagnosis. Of ten it \nwa s confused with the medical term, failure to thrive (FTT), which previously was recorded \non Axis III in the DSM-IV, separating out organic from non-organic causes of feeding \npr oblems. If it were an organic cause it would receive the FTT diagnosis and if no organic \nca use could be found it would be labeled as FDIEC, a psychiatric diagnosis. AR FID was \ncr eated to include those who might have both a psychological and medical problem \nco ntributing to the feeding or eating issues (Fisher et al., 2013). AR FID was also created to \nhe lp those who develop the feeding or eating problem after six years old as well as those who \nha ve significant impairment without weight loss, both of which were inclusion criteria for \nFD IEC (APA, 2000; APA, 2013). AR FID Criteria Gi ven that ARFID is a new diagnosis, it can be useful to discuss the relevant criteria. \n E BSCOhost: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:18:15 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

The restricting has to result in at least one of the following: (1) weight loss or \nfail ure to meet weight gains; (2) nutritional deficiency; (3) reliance on enteral feeds or \nsupp lements; or (4) causes significant impairment (APA, 2013). Unli ke with AN, ARFID \ncove rs eating and feeding problems not associated with significant body image concerns or \nweig ht/shape control behavior, and cannot occur exclusively during anorexia or bulimia. \nThes e patients can realistically appraise their own body and often report they do not like \nbein g small and want to grow and gain weight.

Inst ead of separating out organic vs. non-\norga nic problems, ARFID can co-occur with a medical condition, though the severity must be \nin e xcess of what one would expect from the medical problems alone (APA, 2013). ARFI D \ncan be distinguished from picky eaters, which is found in up to 21% of children, because with \nthos e who are picky eaters, growth is not affected and there is no significant impairment \nover all (Jacobi et al., 2008). More than half of patients who are picky eaters improve with no \ntrea tment at all within a few years (Jacobi et al., 2008). ARFI D is more persistent and \ntypi cally associated with more severe impairment. \nThe criteria for ARFID were created as a result of criticism of the previous DSM-IV \ndiag nosis for feeding disorder of infancy and early childhood (FDIEC). With FDIEC, the \ncrit eria emphasized a failure to gain weight or weight loss, excluding those with other forms \nof s ignificant impairment (Williams et al., 2009). Furt hermore, FDIEC required a one-month \ntime frame, which is thought to be redundant and excessive in a very young child; thus \nARFI D has no time frame cutoff. Prev ious studies demonstrated difficulty in distinguishing \nbetw een organic vs. non-organic problems, showing a substantial number of infants thought \nto h ave a non-organic or psychological cause later ended up having an organic cause for not \neati ng, such as oral motor dysfunction (Reilly et al., 1999). Thus , ARFID criteria permit a \nmedi cal or organic diagnosis provided the feeding and eating difficulties are in excess of what \none would except with the medical issues alone (APA, 2013; Kreipe & Palomaki, 2012). \nFDIE C was often confused with AN; thus ARFID clarifies the difference and that one cannot \nhave a body image distortion with ARFID (APA, 2013; Kreipe & Palomaki, 2012). Perh aps \none of the greatest criticism of FDIEC was the age cutoff of six years old, which was \nelim inated for AFRID because it is now known that feeding/eating disorders can occur at any \nage (Kreipe & Palomaki, 2012). Ofte n the traumatic type of ARFID (i.e., post \nchok ing/vomiting) can occur at any age, while those with the sensory type can start out in \nchil dhood and persist long into adulthood (Kreipe & Palomaki, 2012). De mo graphics and Literature on ARFID \n \nGi ve n that ARFID is a new diagnostic term and that eating disorder DTPs have primarily \nbeen utilized to treat patients with AN and BN, there is a paucity of literature examining \ntrea tment of ARFID both generally and in DTP settings. One study estimated the prevalence \nof A RFID amongst patients with EDs at 13.8%, with it being more likely to occur in males \n(aro und 29%, compared to 15% for AN) (Fisher et al., 2014).

Litera ture also provides that patients with \nARFID tend to be younger (Fisher et al., 2014), around 12 years old as compared to 14-16 \nyears old for AN. As exp lained in the criteria for ARFID, studies show these patients, unlike \nthose with AN, do not have body image distortion or engage in intentional methods of weight \nloss. In ter ms of comorbidities, one study showed anxiety disorders were both highly prevalent \nin AN and ARFID (58% vs. 50%), with generalized anxiety disorder being the most common \nand AN and ARFID having similar rates of depression (Norris et al., 2014). Anothe r study \nshowed those with ARFID are more likely to have an anxiety disorder and less likely to have \na mood disorder compared to AN (Fisher et al., 2014). Common comorbidities with ARFID \nin cli nical practice mirror those seen with feeding disorders, which are commonly comorbid \nwith A DHD, autism spectrum d/o, intellectual disability, as well as with OCD and anxiety \ndisord ers (Timimi, Douglas and Tsifsopolou, 1997). One st udy highlights that those patients \nwith A RFID are actually more likely to have a comorbid medical condition compared to AN \n(Fishe r et al., 2014). This s tudy also found that the most common type of patients with \nARFID are those who have been picky eaters since childhood (28.7%) whereas those with \nvomiti ng/choking phobia were less common at 13.2% (Fisher et al., 2014). Case r eports also \nshow p atients with food selectivity and autism can develop rare nutritional deficiencies \ninclud ing scurvy (Ma et al., 2016). Specif ically, a case report for an adolescent with ARFID \nhas as sociated it with various nutritional deficiencies including vitamin A, E, K, D, and B12 \nand fo late (Chandran et al., 2015), whereas those with AN typically are not deficient in \nvitami ns and minerals. \nWhile evidence supporting the efficacy of treatment of ARFID in a DTP setting is \nminima l, in clinical practice positive outcomes have been observed. The fe w pieces of \nlitera ture that do exist regarding ARFID and DTPs mostly examine prevalence and are \ndescri ptive in nature. One re cent study, a retrospective chart review of 7-17 year olds in a \nDTP se tting showed 22.5% met criteria for ARFID (39/173) and supported previous literature \nthat A RFID patients are younger and a greater proportion of them are males compared to AN. \nThe st udy showed similar degrees of weight loss and malnutrition for those with ARFID \ncompar ed to AN, highlighted the severity of this disorder, and supported utilization of \nprogra ms of equivalent level of intensity used to treat other EDs. This s tudy also showed the \nARFID group was more likely to be reliant on supplements and have higher co-morbidities of \nanxiet y, pervasive developmental, and learning disorders and were less likely to have co-\nmorbid depressive disorders (Nicely et al., 2014). \n \n \nBi ol og ical Treatment of ARFID in a Day Treatment Program \n \nSimi la r to the other EDs, a team approach is best for treating individuals with ARFID. \nBecaus e of growth failure and high comorbidities with medical problems (Norris et al., 2014), \npatien ts with ARFID require close medical monitoring.

While fo od is the best “medication” to treat ARFID, a role \nfor psyc hiatric medication does exist. Generall y, psychotropic medications may be indicated \nto treat the co-morbid conditions including anxiety and depression. Given th e difficulties of \nfinding a child psychiatrist, especially one able to accept and equipped to treat a patient with \nARFID, D TPs are often the best place for these patients to obtain psychiatric treatment. ED \nDTPs hav e psychiatrists on staff, who can assess the need for medication treatment for \npatients with ARFID. However, often the role of a child and adolescent psychiatrist in an ED \nDTP is t o minimize the use of psychiatric medication or taper these patients off of \nmedicati ons when psychiatric polypharmacy is being utilized, given the limited effectiveness \nof medic ations in treating EDs. \nCompared to patients with ARFID, patients with AN are much more likely to be \nprescrib ed SSRIs (61% vs. 21%) and benzodiazepines (17% vs. 0%) (Nor ris et al., 2014). \nThese pr escription patterns may be a function of the fact that ARFID is a new diagnosis and \nthere is little evidence available on the use of medications to treat it. In gener al, SSRIs are \nthought to be ineffective for AN patients due to their malnourished state, and this is thought \nto be tr ue for patients with ARFID as well. That bei ng said, ARFID can be highly co-morbid \nwith anx iety and depression, and if patients come in at a normal weight, trials of SSRIs may \nbe warra nted. Sometime s refeeding alone can be enough to help improve these patients’ \ndepressi on and anxiety. Given da ily observation, DTPs are often the best place to monitor \nthese pa tients intensely to assess whether there is the need for an SSRI. A few ca se reports \nhave des cribed the use of fluoxetine in patients with ARFID that have been successful \n(Kriepe & Palomaki, 2012). The role of benzodiazepines in ARFID needs to be further \nexamined . While in certain cases low doses can be helpful (i.e., .25-0.5mg lorazepam prn \nbefore a food exposure), often patients with ARFID are younger and, given their \nmalnouri shed state, tolerability of lorazepam or clonazepam can be poor (i.e., disinhibition, \nsedation , dizziness, etc.). \nPatients with ARFID often have a co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD.

Behavioral experiments involving food exposures can be worked on \nin individ ual sessions.

In patient s with acute \nonset of A RFID, the behavior and fears can be rapidly extinguished, especially if the patients \ndo their h omework and parents make sure they practice the exercises at home.

Often thos e with \nsensory is sues can be described as supertasters, or for a child with a choking phobia, it should \nbe explain ed they have an involuntary/unwanted reflex that can help clear and protect the \nairway but also makes it hard to eat, helping them to learn to relax. Groups in DTP can teach \nCBT skills including self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, and anxiety management \ntechniques .

At this ti me, it is \nvery impor tant to dispel this myth and explain that the family’s relationship problems might \nactually b e a result of the child’s eating problems. The therap ist can coach parents to \nremember h ow they were successful in getting their children to transition from formula to \nsolid food s and gradually widening their diet when they were much younger. It is usef ul to \nhave paren ts recall strategies used to get their toddler to eat certain foods, such as pairing a \nsmall amou nt of the preferred food and gradually increase the un-preferred food with it (e.g., \none pea in a bowl of mac and cheese) (Chatoor & Ganiban, 2003). Modeling e ating new food \nis also ve ry important at family meals (Chatoor & Ganiban, 2003). Thinking b ack to \ntoddlerhoo d, it is challenging for toddlers to resist food that parents and older siblings enjoy. \nWith young er children, parents can pretend to not give them the food to make them want it \neven more (e.g., this is mommy or daddy’s’ food. You can’t have it....fine, I will give you \njust a lit tle piece). Parents sh ould stay neutral and calm whether the child eats the food or not. \nWhen paren ts react to the child refusing the food, often the fear food can be rapidly \ngeneralize d and the child will not be willing to try anything else from the parents’ plate \n(Chatoor & Ganiban, 2003). One challe nge in the FBT approach for patients with ARFID is \nthat often these children have had developmental disabilities and the parents never had that \nsuccess in getting them to eat early on, which adds an extra challenge in treatment. \nIndividual therapy should not be the sole form of treatment for ARFID.

Addressing t hese social factors, such as struggles \nwith parenta l and sibling relationships, is accomplished by using an FBT informed approach \nwithin the D TP setting, including by having family meals and sessions, multi-family meals \nand meetings , and parent support groups. Siblings are also included in the DTP setting and \nare encourag ed to act as cheerleaders, but not to act as parents, as described in FBT. \nFurthermore, when siblings are involved in the DTP treatment, underlying issues of jealousy \nand competit ion for parental attention can be addressed, thereby improving the siblings’ \nrelationship . Meeting othe r siblings in the multifamily forum can also prove helpful. \nAdditional s ocial factors contributing to and perpetuating the ED include struggles with \npeer relatio ns and being teased or bullied in school. Observing th eir social struggles and \nhelping to i mprove their social skills and ability to foster friendships in the DTP setting is of \nutmost impor tance. Often those with ARFID and co-morbid autism spectrum disorder \nparticularly benefit from the social skills training incorporated into the group setting in the \nDTP. Social expos ures are often incorporated into the treatment for those with ARFID and \nco-morbid so cial anxiety (i.e., they go on trips to the cafeteria and order food for themselves \nwith guidanc e from staff). DTPs are ide al settings to gradually help transition these patients \nback to scho ol to make sure they can continue to eat and gain weight there. \nAcademic str uggles can also be a stressor contributing to ARIFD, as many of these \npatients hav e co-morbid ADHD and learning disorders. Observing th ese patients in the school \nsetting with in the DTP can help identify their needs better. Typically DT P Teams are \nknowledgeabl e in advocating for IEP/504 plans to be initiated or modified, and DTP Teams \ncan be in cl ose contact with the patient’s school (provided the parents give written consent). \nLikewise, ha ving low self-esteem is a significant contributing and perpetuating factor for \nARFID. DTPs are opt imal settings for helping patients build their lives outside of the ED. \nPatients can discover new hobbies in the DTP setting either via various art therapy and \nrecreational groups or as a result of the encouragement given to parents to enroll their \nchildren in school and community activities; in turn this enables patients to develop \nconfidence a nd enjoy pleasurable activities again. \nIt is often useful to involve case management upon discharge from DTP.

Given the comp rehensive treatment available in DTPs, \nthey can provi de treatment in one setting targeting all three areas. Though ARFID c an often \nbe chronic in nature, these patients can sometimes rapidly decompensate to complete food \nrefusal, resul ting in medical instability and requiring a medical hospitalization or a psychiatric \neating disorde r hospitalization if medically stable yet unable to eat. While we have little \nevidence to da te of the effectiveness of DTPs in treatment of ARFID, in clinical practice they \nseem to both p revent hospitalizations and help patients to transition to outpatient treatment \nwhen being dis charged from a hospital (Golden et al., 2015). Based on clini cal experience, \nDTPs can be he lpful in treating ARFID regardless of the nature of the food refusal. For \nexample, in ch ronic cases of those with sensory/textural issues, depending on how \nlongstanding a nd severe the problem is, an intense daily program targeting the ARFID from \nall perspectiv es can often aid the patient in adding new foods to their diet and improving \nvariety and we ight gain. Often lengthy DTP stays are required to make improvement in \npatients who h ave been struggling with ARFID since birth. While one migh t argue good \nweekly exposur e therapy is effective in acute onset ARFID due to choking/vomiting phobia, \noften times th ese patients can rapidly improve within one to two weeks of exposure therapy \n(Kreipe & Palo maki, 2012) in a DTP setting. In our experie nce DTPs allow for very intense, \nrepetitive exp osures, in which success can be mastered fairly quickly, especially when parents \nare actively i nvolved in the DTP setting and they practice these food exposures at home in the \nevenings and o n weekends.

Many groups \nfoc us on body im age issues (e.g., CBT groups help patients reframe negative thoughts about \ntheir bodies), c oping skills, and behaviorally-based strategies to avoid engaging in restricting, \nbinging, and pur ging, all of these issues are less relevant to patients with ARFID. In addition, \nDT Ps are often l imited in size and staffing, making it difficult to have two groups running at \nthe same time (i .e., one for ARFID and one for AN/BN) or have a one-on-one session with \nthe patient with ARFID instead. \nThe psychiatric co-morbidities associated with ARFID often make it difficult to treat in a \ngeneral ED DTP. For example, pat ients with ARFID often have ADHD that cannot be treated \ndue to their low weight or vital sign abnormalities. As a result, the se patients struggle with \nsitting through an entire group and/or listening to, and benefiting from, the information \ntaught. Similarl y, those with ARFID are often on the autism spectrum or have an intellectual \ndisability that renders them unable to benefit significantly from the group therapy. While the \nDTP’s social ben efits are arguably one of their most important aspects, patients with ARFID \nwho struggle soc ially due to autism spectrum disorder or social anxiety often do not fit in \nwell with their peers, which can further lower their self-esteem. Sometimes these complications ev en pose a milieu problem because patients with AN/BN feel irritated or \neasily annoyed b y those with ARFID and autism spectrum disorder and/or ADHD, and they \nwill consequentl y withdraw from the milieu or the program. \nMeals for patien ts with ARFID in a mixed ED setting can also pose challenges. The rules \nare t ypically mu ch different for these patients than for those with AN and BN.

Although no \nevide nce-based gui delines currently exist concerning how patients with ARFID should be \ntreated generally (or in a DTP setting), we have found the following strategies helpful in our \nprogram. First, su ccess in a DTP setting for these patients often requires more one-on-one \nwork and individua lized sessions. In addition to ind ividual sessions by psychiatrists and \npsychologists, soc ial workers, nutritionists, art therapists, etc. can also have individual \nsessions with the patient. This can often pro ve more beneficial to patients with ARFID \ncompared to the gr oup sessions. Additionally, invo lving parents more frequently than the \ntypical one family session per week has been beneficial to these patients, who are often \nyounger. Likewise, given th eir age and psychiatric co-morbidities, it is often more reasonable \nto expect patients to participate only in half of a group. It is often feasib le at times to work \nwith insurance com panies to truncate days and make them shorter so as to be more age \nappropriate.

Notably, prizes ha ve to be individualized for the patient.

He did not like how most foods tasted and felt \nnervous around food, with certain limited exceptions, such as candy and Kraft American \ncheese slices that w ere wrapped in plastic. Meat and vegetables were particular fear foods. He \nwould take home his school lunches and hide them under his bed, as he did not feel \ncomfortable throwing them out due to his hoarding issues. He denied any fear o f gaining \nweight and felt sad about being smaller than his peers. He denied any histor y of \nbinging/vomiting/die t pill/laxative/diuretic use/etc. or eating non-food items/rumination of \nfood.

By \nthat point, he had not yet gained any weight, but he had broadened somewhat the variety in \nhis diet. Parents brou ght him ba ck to DTP a week later. A mixture of a CBT/exp osure based \ntherapy, combined with an FBT informed approach was used. He was a challenge to manage \nin groups due to his A DHD and hoarding. To help him function b etter in group, a low dose of \nshort-acting stimulant was introduced (methylphenidate 5mg was started and increased to \n10mg). Upon tolerating the me thylphenidate, he was switched to methylphenidate ER (18mg \ndaily) and he function ed better in groups and schools. His weight increased f rom 67 pounds to \n70 pounds in three wee ks, and he ate better at home. As a result, his paren ts requested \ndischarge. \nHowever, a few months later, he was admitted as an inpatient to the hospital for food \nrefusal that resulted in his weight loss from 72 pounds to 67 pounds. Thereafter, he was \nmo tivated to eat by us ing a behavioral chart with stickers to earn trips to the gift store, video \ngame time, music time, etc. His methylphenidate ER had previously been increased as an \noutpatient to 27mg PO daily but was discontinued upon admission to help him to eat better. \nHe was discharged at 7 0 pounds, ten days later with follow up at DTP again. \nDuring his DTP admissi on, he continued gaining weight, varied his diet, and learned to \neat new foods includin g bagels with butter and peanut butter sandwiches. While his primary \ndie t consisted of the foods he loved, such as McDonald’s fries and milk shakes, parents \nworked on pairing his favorite food with fear foods (e.g., he had to have a cheeseburger with \nhis fries, eating meat for the first time, he had to eat a string bean to obtain a brownie, and \nparents substituted ch ocolate pediasures for chocolate). An FBT approach helped empower \nparents to set limits and feed him the food he needed to be healthy. They were able to add more protein, fruits, and vegetables into his diet.

In \nprevious literature, the term was used to describe odd presentations of AN, such as AN \noccurring in those on th e spectrum or in those with a medical illness, which would now be \ndiagnosed as ARFID (APA, 2013; Kreipe & Palomaki, 2012). Often the term atypical AN \nwas used to describe tho se with AN who did not report any body image distortion or fear of \nweight gain (Dalle-Grave et al., 2008), which are no longer required for a diagnosis of AN in \nDSM-5 (APA, 2013). When patients did not me et at least one of the diagnostic criteria for \nAN in DSM-IV (e.g., amen orrhea or weight below the 85% IBW cut-off), sub-threshold AN \nwould be diagnosed under EDNOS (APA, 2000; Thomas, Vartanian, Brownell, 2009). Those \nwith this diagnos is ofte n were not monitored as closely as those with AN, and at times \ninsurance would not cove r these patients to receive treatment in a DTP. \nObesity is a massive pro blem in our country, as well as worldwide. Unfortunately, it does not only affect adults. Almost 16.9% of kids 2 t o 19 years old are obese, with 8.1% of infants \nand toddlers having a hi gh weight as well (Ogden et al., 2014). Surprisingly, evidence-b ased \ntreatment for obesity is limited. The new term, atypical A N, found in DSM-5 under the “other \nspecified feeding or eat ing disorders” (OSFED) category, refers to patients who typically start \nout as obese or overweig ht and lose a large amount of weight by engaging in ED behaviors \nthough their current wei ght is still not significantly abnormal (APA, 2013; Forman et al., \n2014). Atypical AN patie nts pre sent as overweight or normal weight given their height, age, \nand sex, but their histo ry is essentially identical to that of someone with AN in that they \nrestrict their eating to minimal kcals daily, may exercise for hours per day, are highly \npreoccupied with their b ody image and weight loss, and may engage in binging and purging \nbehaviors as well. Patie nts with atypical A N exhibit classic AN behaviors, including losing a \nlarge percentage of thei r body weight, yet are still normal or above normal weight because \ntheir weight started out as overweight or obese.

In DSM-IV, these patient s ended up in the \nEDNOS category and would have been called sub-threshold AN, a term that included other \ncategories of patients s uch as those who met all criteria for AN but still had their periods or \nthose did not report any fear of gaining weight (APA, 2000). Like with EDNOS, for OFS ED, \nsignificant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning must \nalso be present and full criteria for any of the other ED diagnoses cannot exist. Also like \nEDNOS, OSFED includes ex amples of situations that can meet the diagnosis. OSFED \nincludes atypical AN as well as sub-threshold bulimia, sub-threshold BED, purging d/o, and \nnight eating syndrome (A PA, 2013). Therefore, while atypica l AN was described in DSM-IV \nunder the EDNOS category , it now possesses its own name and separate subcategory in \nOFSED, which is useful i n calling more attention to this important presentation. Atypical AN \nis thought to be more pr evalent than AN (Stice et al., 2013), but its diagnosis is more likely to \nbe missed because these patients present at a normal weight or overweight. \nThe weight criteria were problematic for the diagnosis of AN, especially for children and \nadolescents who often do not present with the same chronicity as adults (Thomas, Roberto, \nBrownell, 2009). While t he DSM-IV weight criteria were never meant to be interpreted \nliterally, in practice, most clinicians and certainly insurance companies adhered to these \n EBSCOhost: eBook Collec tion (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:18:15 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

The sugge sted 85% IBW cut off criteria for the diagnosis of AN did not apply \nwell to children or adoles cents, who could still suffer serious health consequences with lower \namounts of weight loss (Th omas, Roberto, Brownell, 2009). Further, this weight sugge stion \nfailed to take into accoun t age, sex, and developmental norms. Studies show that amongst the \nprevious EDNOS group that the most common reason for a patient to be diagnosed with sub \nthreshold AN was that the weight cut-off was not met (Watson & Andersen, 2003). One study \nshowed that the prevalence of AN would increase significantly if the old cut off criteria were \nchanged from 85 to 90% IBW (Thaw et al., 2001). By eliminating the weight cut off (and \namenorrhea) criteria for A N in DSM-V, more patients should receive a diagnosis of full \nblown AN than before. None theless, atypical AN i s much more common (Stice et al., 2013) \ngiven the large prevalence of those who are overweight and that one must still be significantly \nunderweight in order to re ceive a diagnosis of AN in DSM-5. \nDespite the weight differe nce between AN and atypical AN, few other differences exist. \nIt has been shown that tho se with sub-threshold AN can be just as impaired as those with AN \n(Swanson et al., 2011), an d the same is thought to be true for those with atypical AN.

Unfortun ately, these patie nts often receive the message that they need to \nlose more weight, which fu rther strengthens the illness. While neither those with A N nor \nthose with atypical AN typ ically want help, one difference noted in clinical practice is that \nthose with atypical AN fee l less entitled to help since they think they are not as good or as \nsick as those with AN and thus feel unworthy of treatment. \n While there is a common m isperception that EDNOS or OSFED is less serious than AN, \nmore similarities than dif ferences exist. Like with AN, those with a typical AN have an \nintense fear of gaining we ight or persistent behaviors interfering with weight gain (APA, \n2013). Both typically lack recogn ition of the seriousness of the weight loss. It is critical to \nacknowl edge that both can have severe medical complications from the ED. Often those with \natypical AN present as sic ker upon admission because the illness went unnoticed for so long, \nas AN is often diagnosed s ooner. On one hand, the long-term complications of being \noverweight can be devastat ing. On the other hand, the unh ealthy manner in which the weight \nwas lost, or the ED behavi ors that were used to lose the weight, not to mention the severity of \nthe thoughts about their w eight and body, make atypical AN a serious disorder. \n Distinguishing between AN and atypical AN can be challenging at times due to the \nelimination of the IBW cut -off for AN. There are age, sex, cultur al, and personal norms \nwhich can contribute to th e judgment call if someone is of significantly low weight and \nreceives a diagnosis of AN or atypical AN. A healthy weight can diffe r by individual, so that \ntwo individuals can be at the same height yet one can be healthy and the other unhealthy at \nthe same weight. Furthermo re, certain insti tutions or insurance companies still use their own \ncutoffs for AN and atypica l AN. It should be noted that th e CDC uses BMI percentiles for \nchildren and adolescents a nd that those in the 5\nth\n to 95\nth\n percentile a re conside red normal \n(CDC, 2015), though those with atypical AN can have a higher BMI percentile yet still have \nlab and vital sign abnorma lities and subjective signs (e.g., low energy/hair thinning) \nindicative of malnutrition . One study showed discrepan cies were possible within a 15-pound \nweight range for females a nd a 25-pound weight range for males for diagnosing AN vs. \nEDNOS, depending on what s ite the patient was at (Thomas, Roberto, Brownell, 2009). \nMany argue that, with the exception of the weight, atypical AN or subthreshold AN, and AN \n EBSCOhost: eBook Collecti on (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:18:15 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

That said, \nit may be more d ifficult for patients with atypical AN to tolerate weight gain in a DTP where \nthey are surrounded by peers of a much lower weight. Often other physicians and i nsurance \ncompanies struggle with unde rstanding the need for weight gain in this population, sending \nmixed messages to these pati ents. At times it is difficult to obtain insurance coverage for \nDTPs because reviewers perce ive the patient’s weight to be normal. However, it is anything \nbut normal for a child or ad olescent to have lost half of his or her body weight in a few \nmonths, as many of these pat ients do. \nThose with atypical AN are i n a relative state of emaciation. Determining a patient’s \ntar get weight can be particu larly difficult as the standard IBW estimates (for a female, 100 \npounds + 5 pounds for each i nch of height over 5 feet) (Peterson et al., 2016) do not apply. \nLooking at previous growth c urves, however, can be useful in determining target weights. For \nexample, if the adolesc ent w as always at the 95\nth\n percentile but she dropp ed to the 70\nth\n \npercentile, notwithstan din g the fact that she may appear to be at a normal weight, she often \nhas to gain weight back to t he 95\nth\n percentile in order for her vital signs to stabilize and for \nher periods to return. Often the target weight cann ot be known ahead of time, and the patient \nsimply has to be re-fed and gain weight to determine the precise number at which medical \nstability can be achieved an d ED thoughts have resolved. In fact, further weight gain is often \nneeded not just to regain me dically stability but to clear up the patient’s thought process and \nto help improve depressive/a nxiety symptoms. \nOne strategy in refeeding pa tients with atypical AN is to start with a 2000 kcal diet and \nfocus on normalizing eating behavior. Some patients will gain weig ht on a 2000 kcal diet due \nto the slowing of their meta bolism by the ED. If they gain rapidly on 2000 kcals, lowering \nkcals below this number is i nappropriate because the body is simply trying to return to its set \npoint. More importantly, low ering t he kcals number can trigger binging/purging. From a \npsychological standp oint, th e more the kcals are lowered the more patients receive the \nmessage that they are eating and gaining too much, which can then cause patients to start \nrestricting again. It should be noted that, in order to gain the weight back, patients with \natypical AN often require a large number of kcals (3000+) for weight gain, as do patients with \nAN. However, like those with AN, those with atypical AN who have lost a large amount of \nweight often need to be star ted on a low number of kcals at first in order to minimize the risk \nof refeeding syndrome.

Fornari 212 \ntreatment goal ( Lock & Vi a, 20 15) until a stable weight is achieved (Yager, 2005). After \nsteady weight gain is c leared and patients are medically stable, light, supervised activity can \nbe considered to help with dep ressive/anxiety symptoms and to slow down weight gain if it \nbecomes too rapid. This should be monitored caref ully, however, as it may trigger ED \nbehaviors. Indeed, it is impor tant for ph ysicians to closely manage the weight of patients with \natypical AN into the future, a s sometimes patients may need to lose weight at some point \n(though this is not recommende d for many years out of concern that these patients are unable \nto lose weight in a healthy ma nner and the ED may be triggered again). \nIn terms of the use of psychia tric medication for treatment of atypical AN, very limited \nresearch exists. In terms of t reatment for AN, studies have shown that, in the acute, \nmalnourished state, SSRIs do n ot appear to be helpful for weight-gain purposes or for treating \ndepressive/anxiety symptoms (A ttia et al., 1998). But for adults with bulimia ne rvosa, \nfluoxetine is FDA-approved and strong evidence exists that it helps decrease binging and \npurging and helps improve depr essive symptoms as well (Levine, 1992). Some evidence also \nexists tha t fluoxetine is help ful for adolescents with BN (Lock & Via, 2015). This leads one \nto wonder if S SRIs may be more effective in atypical AN given that these patients are at a \nhigher weight, like those pati ents with BN. Given that these patients are in a relative \nmalnourished state, however, S SRIs may not be effective. As no evidence-based treatment exists for treating atypical A N, use of medications should generally be limited. In clinical \npractice, though, those with a typical AN, some of whom may have also engaged in \nbinging/purging and/or are sig nificantly depressed or anxious, SSRIs may be of help. SSRIs \nshould only be initiate d if th e patient has minimal or no GI symptoms (due to the risks of \nSSRIs worsening GI symptoms) a nd if informed consent is given for the limited use of these \nmedications. Unfortunately, th e percent bod y weight or ideal body weight at which SSRIs \nwill be effective is unknown. As always, the risks and benef its of using SSRIs should be \ncarefully weighed. For example , if the patient ha s active suicidal ideation, the risk of not \ntreating the issue seems likel y to outweigh the risk of side effects or potential ineffectiveness. \nThere is some evidence, mostly in the form of case reports and open label studies, for the \nuse of atypical antipsychotics (mainly olanzapine) in treatment of AN for adolescents \n(Boachie et al., 2003, Dennis et al., 2006, Powers et al., 2002).

It typically works well for \ntho se less than 18 years old who have been sick for less than 3 years (Russell & Treasure, \n1989). In contrast, we do not ne cessari ly know which, if any, treatment works best when \ntreating atypical AN. Given that patients with atypica l AN do not appear emaciated and \npotentially may suffer less effe cts on their brain from starvation, one may wonder if therapy \nwill help these patients to eat better. Future studies may show more of a role for therapy in \natypical AN, as it does for BN. However, we also know these pati ents are in a relative state of \nrelative emaciation compared to their original weight, and, given the acute and severe nature \nof their weight loss, their cogn itive capacity can be the same or worse than someone with AN, \nconsequently limiting the effect iveness of therapy. Thus, studies are needed to exam ine their \ncognitive capacity and the effec tiveness of different therapies for atypical AN. \nThough limited evidence exists f or the effectiveness of treatments for atypical AN, our \nDTP relies on an FBT-informed ap proach for treating all eating disorders.

In clinical practice, an FBT for atypical AN modeled after \nthe AN approach, rather than BN approach, is more appropriate because strict parental control \nis needed (Lock & LeGrange, 2013 ). Often those with atypical AN are even more resistant to \nand fearful of gaining weight, a s they have memories of being severely teased due to their \ncurrent and previous maximum wei ght. \nAdditionally, although not forma lly studied, various forms of group therapy exist in an \nED DTP setting that have proven helpful when treating these patients. Some patients with \natypical AN have dabbled in bing ing/purging and have a lot of cluster B traits and self-\ninjurious behavior. These patien ts benefit highly fr om DBT, which helps them with distress \ntolerance. CBT-E (enhanced cogni tive behavi oral therapy for EDs) is the gold standard for \nBN, and interpersonal therapy (I PT) is the only therapy that rivals it (NICE, 2004). Evidence \nexists that both help with binge eating disorder (BED) as well. Given that those with atypical AN often appear to have a normal weight and often can engage in some binging/purging, \nthese other therapies may be use ful as well. \nFew studies guide the treatment of individuals with OSFED, Other Specified Feeding or \nEating Disorder, a term that inc ludes atypical AN. We do, however, possess some evi dence \nregarding which therapies are ef fective for the ED NOS group in DSM-IV (Fairburn et al., \n2009; Murphy et al., 2010), whic h OSFED resembles. CBT-E is thought to help with ED NOS \nand OFSED (Fairburn et al., 2009 ), though CBT-E is known to be less effective for the acute \nphase of AN when the brain is st arved, which raises questions as to how effective CBT-E is \nfor atypical AN. CBT-E is aimed to target the cog nitive disturbance in eating disorders (i.e., \nthe over-evaluation of eating, s hape, and weight), and modifying sustaining factors such as \nperfectionism, core low self-est eem, mood intolerance, and interpersonal difficulties.

Those with atypica l AN compare thems elves to those with AN and especially \ncompare their food. While they strug gle with eating more kcals than their peers, they can \nstruggle with eating less as well. O ften those with atypical AN can act ually gain weight on a \nlower amount of kcals (though at oth er times some may need as many kcals as someone with \nAN would). As treatment progresses i t may be re asonable to switch them from whole milk to \nskim milk or ensures to pediasures, which all reinforces the message in their mind that they \nare “fat” or “not good enough” and n eed to lose more weight. Additionally, treatment of \npatients with atypical AN often pose s a challenge for those in a DTP setting with AN because \nthose with AN often view those with atypical AN and resist eating and challenge staff as a \nresult because they think they will end up overweight and looking like their peers in the \nprogram with atypical AN. \n \n \nModif ications for Caring for Pat ie nt s with Atypical AN in a Day \nTreatment Setting \n \nWhen treating t hose with atypical AN , it should be emphasized at the outset to all \npatients in the milieu that eating d isorders come in all shapes and sizes (Thomas et al., 2013). \nThis message should likewise be emph asized in multi-family meetings and parent support \ngroups to help the parents to foster an understanding of atypical AN. An atmosphere of \ntolerance should b e emphasized; and any sort of bullying or teasing of those with atypical AN \nshould be addressed immediately in b oth individual and group sessions. At times, those who \nengage in bully ing/teasing need to f ace repercussions, such as by dropping a patient’s level. \nConversely, it is of utmost importan ce to praise and promote as group president those patients \nwho support all their peers. \nAlthou gh appropriate for all EDs, wh en treating those with atypical AN and AN in the \nsame milieu, it is particularly usef ul to discourage patients from comparing themselves with \ntheir peers, and instead encourage t heir radical acceptance of themselves and the situation.

Therefore they require help in accep ting what they \ncannot (or should not) change as wel l as in acknowledging that their weight is not just a \nmeaningless number but rather the nu mber that will enable them to stay healthy and lead \nproductive lives outside of the hosp ital or DTP.

Indeed , it is c ritic al to empower thes e patients to focus on things that they can \ncontrol and change in their lives to m ake themselves happy. Activities that help build self-\nestee m and a life outside the ED shoul d be a priority. Staff should help the patients to expl ore \nnew hobbies, many of which can be atte mpted in DTP including doing puzzles, knitting, \ndrawing, music, etc. Further, in-progr am successes such as answering questions correctly in \ngroups, being voted president by peers , leading a multi-family meeting, etc. can help build \npatients’ self-esteem and confidence i n preparation for when they eventually leave the \nprogram and return to their previous s chool environment. \nGroups in the milieu and individual se ssions should focus on addressing issues \nunderlying the illness and exploring a ny adaptive functions of the ED. For example, if a \npatient is refusing to go to school, i t should be addressed in DTP. Options include helping the \npatient t o get an IEP, transfer to an alternative school, or preferably working on a gradually \ntransition back to school. The milieu should also focus on having those with atypical AN \nlearn to befriend others, not only in the program but more importantly with peers outside of \nthe program. During individual session s, having the patient choose an afterschool activity or \ncommunity club to join, or trying a ne w hobby to meet peers with a similar interest, can be \nuseful in fostering the patient’s self -esteem and remedying the isolation that often maintains \nEDs. \nIt should be emphasized that mos t of t hese patients should be on a weight gain plan like \ntheir peers with AN, and require a sim ilar number of kcals. Rather than just looking at the \nactua l number on the scale, one must r emember these patients lost a large amount of weight \nand need to gain it back for health re asons. In many cases, being on a lower number of kcals \nin DTP can lead to more weight gain. I f these patients go home hungry, they often eat in \nsecret at home and increasing their ca lories in a controlled setting can help prevent against \nbinging, which will also help prevent against purging. \nFor some patients with atypical AN, li ght activity can be added back to the treatment plan \nsooner than for someone with AN. Befor e doing so, the patient should be medically stable \nand cleared by the medical team for li ght exercise, such as a 20-minute walk three times per \nweek.

Chapter 2 EATING DISORDERS IN ATHLETES Marios Argyrides * , and Charis Ioannou Neapolis University Pafos, Paphos, Cyprus INTRODUCTION Eating disorders are considered serious psychiatric disorders that remain difficult to treat. They also have a significant impact on the health and performance of athletes. The most extreme manifestations of eating disorders, such as Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa, are very often associated with factors such as diet and/or obsession with food (orthorexia), dissatisfaction with body image and preoccupation with body weight (Stice et al., 2011). There is an increased prevalence of eating disorders among athletes as compared to the general population (Sundgot-Borgen, Skarderud, & Rodgers, 2003). This may not come as a surprise if we take into consideration that within sports, there is a greater focus on body, food and performance (Sundgot-Borgen, Skarderud, & Rodgers, 2003). According to Sundgot- Borgen, Skarderud, and Rodgers (2003), within athletes, there is an encouragement for control through bodily techniques and a culture of “pushing your boundaries.” Furthermore, in regards to dieting behaviour, there is a lack of norms for what is “normal.” It is widely known that participation in sport activities, contributes positively to the improvement of physical fitness, increases self-esteem and generally gives a more positive body image. However, in competitive sports, the large amount of training, unusual dietary practices and reduced food intake could contribute to the development of eating disorders and/or disordered eating. In sports such as rhythmic and artistic gymnastics, martial arts, weightlifting, etc., where the criteria of weight control are strict, the probability of disordered eating and/or eating disorders developing is much higher (Sundgot-Borgen, Skarderud, & Rodgers, 2003). It has been claimed that female athletes are at increased risk for developing eating disorders due to the focus upon low body weight as a performance enhancer, comments from coaches or important others, and the pressure to perform (Otis et al., 1997; Sundgot-Borgen, 1994; Wilmore, 1991). * Corresponding e-mail: m.argyrides.1@nup.ac.cy. 2016.

Th e chapter on Feeding and Eating \nDi sorders in the fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-V) includes several changes to better \nre present the symptoms and behaviors of patients dealing with these conditions across the \nli fespan (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). \nTh e changes in the DSM-V were planned to reduce the number of diagnoses which fell \nin to the EDNOS (Eating Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified) category (or its renamed \nco unterpart), by accommodating more precise descriptions of patient symptoms as well as \nne wer research on eating disorders. Si nce the changes were implemenmeted, several studies \nha ve shown reductions in EDNOS diagnoses rates using the DSM-V criteria (Machado, et al., \n20 13; Nakai, et al., 2013). \nTh e diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa has undergone the greatest number of changes. Un til \nth e publication of the fifth edition of the DSM, individuals were required to have a weight \nle ss than 85% of “normal.” Th is has been updated to state that significantly low weight is \n“l ess than minimally normal weight in adults or less than expected weight in children and \nad olescents.” Mo reover, patients no longer need to explicitly endorse a fear of weight gain; \nth is can now be inferred from the patient’s behaviors. Th is change is expected to be \npa rticularly beneficial in the athlete population, because athletes may refuse, or even ignore \nsy mptoms in an effort to continue competing. Fi nally, amenorrhoea has been discarded as a \ndi agnostic criterion for Anorexia Nervosa. St udies found that women who otherwise met the \ncr iteria of Anorexia with or without regular menses did not differ clinically from women with \nsi milar symptoms plus amenorrhoea (Call et al., 2013). By excluding amenorrhoea as a \ndi agnostic requirement enables also the diagnosis of Anorexia in men, postmenopausal \nwo men and adolescents with delayed menarche (Joy et al., 2016). \nTh e new definition for Bulimia Nervosa in the DSM-V reduced the required frequency of \nbi nge episodes and reparative behaviors from twice per week to an average of once per week \nov er a period of three (3) months. Th is modification was necessary for two reasons: a) the \nfr equency of binge episodes did not significantly impact prognosis or treatment and b) the \nfr equency caused more EDNOS diagnoses (Wilson & Sysko, 2009). \nDS M-V also created a new formal diagnosis that had previously fallen under EDNOS – \nth at is, Binge Eating Disorder. Fi nally, the assorted category previously called EDNOS has \nbe en changed into two categories—‘Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder,’ and \n‘U nspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder.’ Th e first category is used for individuals who, due \nto specific reasons, do not meet any criteria of the above types of eating disorders. Fo r \nex ample, despite significant weight loss, the patient may remain within the normal weight \nra nge, independently meeting all the other criteria for Anorexia Nervosa.

This may not come as a surprise if \nwe t ake into a consideration that within sports, there is a greater focus on body, food and \nperf ormance (Sundgot-Borgen, Skarderud, & Rodgers, 2003). \nData on the prevalence of eating disorders in athletic populations are limited and \nequi vocal. Desp ite the fact that the majority of studies investigate prevalence in female \nathl etes, the studies that did assess male subjects showed that the prevalence is lower among \nmale athletes as compared to female athletes (Byrne & McLean, 2002; Greenleaf, Petrie, \nCart er, & Reel, 2009; Martinsen, Bratland-Sanda, Eriksson, & Sundgot-Borgen, 2010; Petrie, \nGree nleaf, Reel, & Carter, 2008; Schaal et al., 2011; Sundgot-Borgen & Torstveit, 2004). \nPoss ibly due to the methodological weaknesses of studies conducted such as small \nsamp le size, lack of definition of the competitive level and/or type of sport(s) and lack of \ndefi nition on the data-collection method used, estimates of the prevalence of the symptoms \namon g female athletes range from less than 1% to as high as 75%! (Bur ckes-Miller & Black, \n1988 ; Gadpalle et al., 1987; Sundgot-Borgen, 1994; Warren et al., 1990). The frequency of \neati ng disturbances and pathological dieting practices of male athletes varies from none to \n57%, depending on the definition used and the population studied (Burckes-Miller & Black, \n1988 ; Dummer et al., 1987; Rosen & Hough, 1988; Rucinski, 1989). \nThe prevalence of eating disorders also seems to be dependent upon the type of sport. In spor ts with weight-classes (such as rowing), aesthetic sports (such as gymnastics or figure \nskat ing) and sports where having a low body mass is seen as advantageous (such as cross-\ncoun try or cycling), the rates of eating disorders have generally been higher (Joy et al., 2016). \nA st udy among female athletes supported these conclusions showing that rates of eating \ndiso rders in aesthetic sports and weight-depended sports were 25%, as compared to 12% in \nothe r types of sports (Sundgot-Borgen, 1993). Like wise, in a more recent study by Thiemann \net a l. (201 5), 108 German professional female athletes were age-matched with 108 non-\nathl ete controls. Resu lts of this study indicated that the rates of eating disorders reached 17% \nin a esthetic sports, whereas in ball sports the prevalence was 2%. The prevalence in the non-\nathl ete sample was also 2% (Thiemann et al., 2015). \nThe trend seen in elite female athletes in lean sports is very similar to that of male \nathl etes. Spec ifically, they are both more likely to suffer from an eating disorder as compared \nto a thletes in other sports. Sund got-Borgen and Torstveit (2004) showed that rates of eating \ndiso rders in male athletes in antigravitation sports were 22%, as compared to 9% in \nendu rance sports and 5% in ballgame sports (Sundgot-Borgen & Torstveit, 2004). Thes e \nfind ings were also further supported by Rosendahl et al. (2009), who indicated that the \nprev alence of eating disorders among male athletes in lean-type sports was 10% in endurance \nspor ts, 17% in weight-class sports and 42% in antigravitation sports (Rosendahl et al., 2009). \nA ma jor problem in detecting eating disorders in athletes has always been the research \ntool s used.

Theref ore, researchers \ntried to develop tools specific to athletes. The fi rst tool for the assessment of eating disorders, \nthe Fe male Athlete Screening Tool (FAST; McNulty, Adams, Anderson, & Affenito, 2001) \nwas de veloped especially for use with female athletes. Correl ation analyses showed that the \nFAST w as significantly and strongly correlated to the EDE-Q (0.60) and the EDI (0.89) \n(McNul ty, Adams, Anderson, & Affenito, 2001). The Co ntextual Body Image Questionnaire \nfor At hletes (CBIQA; de Bruin et al., 2011) was the second instrument developed to measure \nmultid imensional body image in daily life and sport. The in ternal validity of this measure was \ndeterm ined using a general, heterogeneous sample of female sport participants and exercisers \n(Bruin et al., 2011). It is worth noting that even the two athlete-specific questionnaires \nmentio ned above, were developed only for female athletes. Theref ore, it is evident that \nassess ment tools concerning eating disorders with male athletes are of great need. \n \n \nEA TI NG DISORDERS AMONG ATHLETES \n \nDiso rd ered eating is more prevalent among athletes than non-athletes (Glazer, 2008) \nillust rating the relative importance of this problem in the athletic community. Most s tudies \nhave l ooked at symptoms of eating disorders such as preoccupation with food and weight, \ndistur bed body image, or the use of pathogenic weight-control methods. \nThe ma jority of the studies investigate the prevalence of eating disorders in female \nathlet es. As sta ted above, among female athletes, the rates of eating disorders vary by sport \nand ha ve generally been higher in sports with weight-classes (such as rowing), aesthetic \nsports (such as gymnastics or figure skating) and sports where having a low body mass is seen \nas adv antageous (such as cross-country or cycling) (Sundgot-Borgen, 1993; Thiemann et al., \n2015). Additi onal studies suggest that the prevalence of disordered eating behaviors (such as \nbingin g, taking laxatives or diuretics, self-induced vomiting, etc.) is higher in the college-\naged p opulation, even in the absence of a formal eating disorder diagnosis (Striegel et al., \n1989). In som e studies, as much as 70% of athletes in weight-class sports were dieting or \nexhibi ting abnormal eating behaviors to reduce their weight before competition (Sundgot-\nBorgen & Torstveit, 2010). \nAn inc reasingly large body of research also indicates that eating disorders and disordered \neating are significant problems among male athletes as well (Chatterton & Petrie, 2013; Dolan \net al. , 2011; Glazer, 2008; Lingor & Olson, 2010; Sundgot-Borgen & Torstveit, 2004).

However, the relational \nfactors that have been reported in the literature are mentioned below. \nNattiv e t al. (2007) indicated that risk factors are rather multifactorial. In their report, \nNattiv e t al. (2007) classified risk factors into “predisposing factors,” “trigger factors” and \n“perpetu ating factors.” Predispo sing factors include biological (e.g., genetics), psychological \n(e.g., b ody dissatisfaction, low self-esteem and personality traits such as perfectionism) and \nsociocul tural factors (e.g., peer pressure, media influence and history of bullying) (Mazzeo & \nBulik, 2 009; Stice, 2002; Stice, Marti, & Durant, 2011). The trig ger factors are typically \nnegative comments regarding body weight and/or shape, traumatic experiences, etc. (Stice, 2002). T he eati ng disorders are maintained by perpetuating factors such as approval by the \ncoach or significant others and the physiological consequences of starvation or initial success \n(Drinkwa ter et al., 2005). \nSmolak, Murnen, and Ruble (2000) and Sundgot-Borgen (1994) generally suggested that \nsport-sp ecific risk factors include: 1) frequent weight regulation 2) dieting and experienced \npressure to lose weight 3) personality traits 4) early start of sport-specific training 5) injuries \nand symp toms of overtraining 6) impression motivation 7) threat perception and 8) the impact \nof coach ing behaviour. Furtherm ore, Currie (2010) supported that the sport environment can \nmake ath letes even more vulnerable to the above mentioned risk factors as compared to non-\nathletes (Currie, 2010). \nFor athl etes in sports which emphasize leanness, reduction in body mass or body fat can, \nin many cases, enhance their performance (Currie, 2010). However, when an initial loss of \nweight l eads to a better performance, this could in turn “force” the athlete to continue dieting \nto lose weight and unknowingly “slip” into an eating disorder (Rodriguez, Di Marco, & \nLangley, 2009). \nAnother important sport-specific risk factor is personality. Thompson and Sherman \n(1999) s uggested that some traits desired by coaches in their athletes, are very similar to traits \nfound in individuals with eating disorders such as excessive exercise, perfectionism, and \n(over) c ompliance. In furth er support of Thompson and Sherman’s (1999) claims, a recent \nreview b y Forsberg and Lock (2006) suggested perfectionism as a central confounding factor \nin the r elationship between athletes and eating disorders (Forsberg & Lock, 2006). \nIn regar","section":"p5"}

Moreover , being highly involved with weight-preoccupied sports such \nas weigh t-class sports at an early and vulnerable age has also been suggested as an increased \nrisk fac tor for developing eating disorders (Currie, 2010). \nAddition ally, psychological traits related to anxiety (i.e., perfectionism) and several \ntraumati c events related to injuries have also been suggested as additional risk factors among \nathletes . More spe cifically, injured athletes regularly experience an undesired weight gain, \nwhich is often combined with the inability to train and/or to participate/compete in \nchampion ships (Sundgot-Borgen, 1994). Conseque ntly, the athlete attempts to maintain \nhis/her weight by using other (unhealthy) methods, such as disordered eating. \n EBSCOho st: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:19:23 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

Coaches ca n have a \ndecisive r ole in the development (or not) of eating disorders in athletes (Currie, 2010). \nBiesecker and Martz (1999) found that a coaching style that is more performance-related and \nbody-weigh t-preoccupied increases body image anxiety, dieting and fear of fatness in \nathletes. In the sam e way, a supportive and caring coaching style may reduce the risk of \neating dis orders (Biesecker & Martz, 1999; Currie, 2010). \nIn differe nt types of sports which emphasize leanness such as aesthetic, endurance and \nweight-cla ss sports, athletes are evaluated on both technical skills and execution/artist effects. \nTherefore, such aesthetical evaluation creates ‘body paradigms’ in these types of sports. Body \npara digms, rules and norms in the specific sports can make athletes more prone to eating \ndisorders, but can also make it a challenge for professionals to identify at-risk athletes \n(Currie, 2 010). \nBased on t he above, one can conclude that there are several risk-factors that have been \nreported t hat seem to be specific to athletes. However, m ore meta-analyses are needed in \norder to a ssess for the effect sizes of these factors, as this may tailor prevention efforts to be \nmore speci fically designed and implemented. \n \n \nMEDICA L IS SUES \n \nEating d is orders have a wide range of health consequences, including one of the highest \nmortality rates of any mental health condition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; \nHarris & B arraclough, 1998; Mehler & Brown, 2015). \nArcelus et al. (2011) and Crow et al. (2009) reported that death is most often caused by \nsuicide or cardiac arrhythmia; suicide accounts also for 20% of deaths among patients with \nAnorexia N ervosa, and 23% among patients with Bulimia Nervosa (Arcelus et al., 2011; \nCrow et al ., 2009).

The FAT is a specific medical condition characterized by three distinct, \nhowever, i nter-related conditions; 1) low energy availability, 2) menstrual dysfunctions and \n3) low bon e mineral density (De Souza et al., 2013; Nattiv et al., 2007; Winstead & Willard, \n2006). \nCo ncerning male athletes, there has been evidence of similar trends to female athletes on \ntwo of thr ee related to males FAT components (i.e., low energy availability (Johnson et al., \n1999; Ling or & Olson, 2010; Reinking & Alexander, 2005; Sundgot-Borgen, 2004; Sykora et \nal., 1993; Thiel et al., 1993) and low bone mineral density (Hetland, 1993; Hind, 2006; Nattiv \net al., 20 13; Papageorgiou & Elliott-Sale, 2015).

As reported previously in the chapter concerning the lack of \nassessment t ools of male athletes, the clear need for further research on the medical issues \nwith male at hletes is once again evident. \n \n \nIDENTIFY IN G ATHLETES WITH EATING DISORDERS \n \nMost of th e athletes with eating disorders do not realize that they have a problem, \ntherefore, t hey do not usually seek treatment on their own. In most case s, a self-concern \nemerges only when the first symptoms of performance deterioration appear (Sundgot-Borgen, \nSkarderud, & Rodgers, 2003). \nPhysicians, athletic trainers, sport psychologists, sport dieticians and physical therapists \nwho usually interact with athletes and active persons, have a very important role in evaluating \ndisordered e ating early-on and referring the athlete for further evaluation of a possible eating \ndisorder. Ea rly identi fication and early intervention are both associated with better treatment \noutcomes (Fi sher, 2006; Rosen, 2010). \nEating disor ders are complex and should not be determined simply based upon an \nathlete’s ph ysique or appearance.

Afterwards, the \ncoach or tra iner must refer the athlete to the appropriate specialist for a professional \nevaluation a nd management of the problem. Since eating disorders can cause irreversible \ndamage and c an be fatal, it is important for those closest to the athlete to remain open to signs \nand symptoms that are consistent with the presence of an eating disorder and to get the athlete \nreferred to a licensed mental health or medical professional as soon as possible.

Team \nmembers often consist of a physician, a sports dietician, a mental health professional and an \nathletic train er. The systematic communication between the team members is critically \nimportant, thu s the team should be in contact and collaboration quite often. As some aspect s \nof their speci alty coincide, it is crucial that they are systematic and consistent in the \ninformation th ey provide to the athlete. Ideally, these individuals should also be familiar with \nthe sport/athl etic environment, as well as the specific sport of the athlete (Ghoch et al., 2013). \nFurthermore, e ven though each treatment team member may be involved with many \ndifferent task s, it is imperative that they all coordinate in order to achieve the desired results \nwith their ath lete/patient. At times, and for the purpose of achieving a more positive \nprognosis, add itional health specialists may serve as consultants to the treatment team \noffering their own expertise in the care of the athlete affected by an eating disorder. These \nspecial ists/co nsultants may be psychiatrists, internal medicine doctors or gastroenterologists \n(Joy et al., 2 016). \nMoreover, when it comes to athletes who continue to live with their parents and/or \nguardians, the engagement and alignment of the treatment team with them is critically \nimportant.

A c haotic or d isruptive family situation (such as divorcing parents) can contribute \nto the develop ment and/or sustainability of an eating disorder. Therefore, it is imperative for \nthe multidisci plinary treatment team to understand the environment in which the athlete lives, \nand take that into account when developing and implementing treatment plans (Rosen, 2010). \nAccording to J oy et al. (2016), the role of the physician in the multidisciplinary team is \nextremely impo rtant. Specifically, Joy et al. (2016) claim that the physician should be the first \nto address any eating disordered behaviors and possible health consequences. In addition, t he \nphysician shou ld support and reinforce the treatment plans of the dietician, the mental health \nprofessional a s well as any other professionals involved in the athlete’s care (Joy et al., 2016). \nThe Norwegian Olympic Training Centre developed a successful treatment program for \nthe treatment of eating disorders in athletes (Sundgot-Borgen, Skarderud, & Rodgers, 2003). \nThe Center tak es into consideration that fact that the athletes with an eating-disorder are more \nlikely to acce pt the idea of going for a single consultation rather than committing themselves \nto prolonged t reatment. Therefore, the Center attempts to engage the patient athlete from the \nfirst session enough to have a second session. Specifically, they work to build a trusting \nrelationship b etween the physician and the athlete, avoiding any physical examinations, blood \ntests, or nutr itional evaluations. A strong thera peutic relationship is often accomplished by \nrespecting the athlete’s desire to be lean for athletic performance. The physician also \nexpresses a wi llingness to work with the eating-disordered athlete to become lean and \nhealthy, withi n of course, the frames of a healthy body, like regular menstruation (Sundgot-\nBorgen, Skarde rud, & Rodgers, 2003). \nThe Center doe s not believe that the coach’s role is to diagnose or treat eating disorders. \nThey believe i t is very important to: 1) educate coaches about the signs and symptoms of \n EBSCOhost: eB ook Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:19:23 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

They suggested t hat the \nclinical assessm ent and management of medical care of athletes with eating disorders should \nfocus on the fol lowing areas: \n \n Function — a ss essing day-to-day functioning \n How have you b een doing since your last visit? \n Is there a tim e of day that your behaviors are better or worse? \n What helps you succeed (with changing behaviors, with treatment, etc.)? \n Are you taking your medications as prescribed? \n Additional que stions to develop rapport and further assess patient functioning \n(e.g., ‘How is s chool? Practice? Work? Family/Fri ends?’ ). \n Physical healt h discussion — discussing health-related topics, such as: \n A targeted sym ptom review: sleep, bowel habits, energy, urination, palpitations, \nsyncope/near-syn cope, menstruation, other issues or concerns \n Eating behavio rs—restriction, binging, purging, etc \n Exercise and t","section":"p9"}

For female \nathl etes, De Sou za and his colleagues (2013) suggest a guide (Female Athlete Triad \nCumulative Risk Assessment) for physicians, which will aid their decision-making process on \nwhether a female athlete is ready to return to her sport. The risk assessm ent tool takes into \naccount: dietary restriction, BMI, menstrual history (delayed menarche, oligomenorrhoea, and \namenorrhoea), bo ne mineral density and history of stress reaction or fracture. Each risk factor carries a point value, and the numeric score suggests whether an athlete should receive full \nclearance, provi sional/limited clearance or restriction from participation (De Souza et al., \n2013). The above risk a ssessment tool must be combined with the clinical decision-making \nskills of the mu ltidisciplinary team in order to make the most appropriate decision (Joy et al, \n2016). \n EBSCOho st: eBoo k Collection (EBSCOhost) printed on 10/26/2025 10:19:23 PM UTC via UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES.

(2013), referring to the Female Athletes Triad, report that \nathletes, coaches and parents should learn that loss of menstruation is not a positive \nadaptation to high -intensity training and sport participation, and symbolizes a state of low \nenergy availabilit y, resulting from either intentional or unintentional dietary restriction (De \nSouza, et al., 201 3). \nAs a general concl usion, educational programmes directed at coaches, athletes and \nparents, should be successful in increasing their knowledge about eating disorders, including \nrecognition and ma nagement (Martinsen et al., 2015). \nIt is widely accep ted that prevention efforts can be very effective with eating disorders. \nTherefore, the Nat ional Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has developed educational \nmaterials specific ally for coaches, athletic administrators and athletes (NCAA Resources \nRelated to Disorde red Eating, 2015). In this material, the developing team identified 10 \nstrategies for coa ches and administrators, which aim to reduce the possibility of disordered \neating and eating disorders among their athletes (Kroshus, 2015). These 10 strategie s are: \n \n1. Be aware of t he sy mptoms of disordered eating. \n2. Consult a regis ter ed dietician who specializes in sport, particularly a Board Certified \nSpecialist in Spor ts Dietetics (CSSD) to prescribe appropriate nutrition for optimal \nsport performance. 3. De-emphasise we igh t: Be aware of how you are communicating to athletes about \nweight and perform ance.

Develop a plan w ith other stakeholders (such as university counselling services or a \nsports registered di etitian) for how to identify and treat student-athletes with eating \ndisorders. \n \n \nCONC LUSION \n \nIt i s clear in the l iterature by now that the prevalence of eating disorders among athletes is \nsignificantly higher than the general population. This is more evident in some types of sports \nthan others. It is a lso evident t hat eating disorders can be easily missed, as athletes would \nrarely ask for help. As described above, this is more evident with male athletes since there are \nno valid assessment tools for recognition of eating disorders in males, nor conceptualization \nmodels. There is a h igh need for the development of such tools and conceptualization models. \nHowever, if eating d isorders remain untreated, they can have long-lasting psychological and \nphysiological effect s which at times, can be fatal. From the chapter, on e can also conclude \nthat several meta-an alyses are needed in order to strengthen the power of certain risk factors, \nespecially in male a thletes. \nPrevention efforts a re very important as well as several risk factors are well-known and \nshould include the i nvolvement of the athletes, the coaches and the parents/guardians. \nTherapeutically, a m ultidisciplinary team of professionals (physician, dietician, mental health \nprofessional, and ot her relevant professionals) should conduct assessment and treatment \nplanning based on th e individual needs of athletes. Last but not least, the coaches and \nparents/guardians of the athletes should be part of the treatment process. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAm er ic an Psychiatr ic Association. (2013).

No vel \nin terventions such as neurosurgical and neuromodulatory treat-\nme nts were discussed, as evidence continues to mount around \nth eir potential utility in treating eating disorders, in particular \nna mely anorexia nervosa. Im portant pragmatic and theoretical \nde velopments around feeding and refeeding approaches \nem erged, and are also discussed. In this review, we carefully \nre view evidence alluding to the potential efficacy of exercise in \npa rtially ameliorating binge eating disorder symptomatology, \nwh ile examining broader evidence underscoring the impor-\nta nce of therapeutically ameliorating compulsive exercise in \nan orexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. In addition, we overview \nev idence relating to the risk and sequelae associated with pre-\nma ture discharge from intensive eating disorder treatment, as \nwe ll as the efficacy of CBT versus group therapy-based main-\nte nance treatments. Fi nally, important developments around \nth e use of open versus blind weighing in treatment are \nas sessed.

Amon g the most lethal psychiatric disorders, EDs lead to 10,200 deaths \nper year in the United States (U.S.) alone and have a staggering lifetime prevalence \nrate of 28.8 million Americans (Deloitte Access Economics, 2020). EDs may span \na ra nge of symptoms including food restriction, binge eating, purging, and other \ncomp ensatory methods, fear-based and sensory aversions to food, and advanced \ndise ase-related medical sequelae such as neurologic, gastrointestinal, osteopathic, \nand cardiac issues (Westmoreland et al., 2016). Alar mingly, even with cutting- \nedge existing treatments, remission rates are modest. For instance, empirical data \nsugg est that approximately 25% to 33% of medically stable adolescents remit from \nanor exia nervosa (AN) (Lock & Le Grange, 2019), up to 30% of those with BN \nfull y remit from symptoms throughout treatment (Linardon et al., 2017), and \nbetw een 18% to 86% of those with binge eating disorder (BED) remit during \ntrea tment (Peat et al., 2017). Howe ver, even among those who do recover, relapse \nis r eported in up to one-third of individuals across ED diagnoses (Sala et al., 2023). \nAs s uch, and while improvements in treatment outcomes have been slow to \nadva nce, novel treatment approaches are critically important.\nOf e qual yet more recent concern, the COVID-19 global pandemic has had \na si gnificant impact on mental health, including on the development and \nexac erbation of EDs (Rodgers et al., 2020). The stress and uncertainty caused \nby t he pandemic, along with changes in lifestyle, such as social isolation and \ndecr eased physical activity, have contributed to increased disordered eating \nbeha viors (Rodgers et al., 2020). In t he context of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nthe prevalence of EDs has increased markedly, with one specialized inpatient \nunit for instance, noting that admissions doubled during the COVID-19 \npand emic (Otto et al., 2021). Addi tionally, access to treatment for EDs may \nhave been disrupted, leading to further challenges in addressing this issue. \nA st udy by Birgegård et al. (2022) in Eating Disorders: The Journal of \nTrea tment & Prevention found illustrated that broader psychiatric risk was \nalso exacerbated among those with EDs, noting in Sweden that during the \npand emic those with more severe EDs demonstrated higher levels of anxiety, \nand subsequently further increased ED symptomatology. Furt hermore, treat-\nment utilization was concerningly low, and for individuals in treatment, there \nwas a reported decrease in the level of care they were receiving as well as the \nfreq uency in which they had treatment sessions. This underscores the urgent \nEATI NG DISORDERS129\n\nneed to optimize ED patient care and outcomes, which in itself is \na long standing concern, and has been inflamed by the complexities brought \nabout by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn aim","section":"p2"}

Furt hermore, treat-\nment utilization was concerningly low, and for individuals in treatment, there \nwas a reported decrease in the level of care they were receiving as well as the \nfreq uency in which they had treatment sessions. This underscores the urgent \nEATI NG DISORDERS129\n\nneed to optimize ED patient care and outcomes, which in itself is \na long standing concern, and has been inflamed by the complexities brought \nabout by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn aim ing to meet this need, several important advances in the treatment of \nEDs ha ve been put forth in Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment & \nPreven tion in 2022. This r eview summarizes these recent contributions to the \nlitera ture relating to the treatment of ED developments, spanning (i) novel \ntreatm ent interventions including neurosurgery, neuromodulation, and high- \ncalori e refeeding (HCR) to treat EDs, namely AN (ii) the role of exercise in the \ntreatm ent of EDs, especially in BED (iii) an assessment of factors predicting \npremat ure discharge from ED treatment and discharge planning efforts that \ninclud e examining the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and \ngroup- based maintenance treatments, as well as exploring the impact of \nopen v ersus blind weighing.\nNovel treatments\nTradit ional methods of treating various EDs have focused primarily on med-\nicatio n and behavioral therapy. Like m any other mental health disorders, \nmedica tion and therapy became the most common approach in clinical \npracti ce for treating EDs. Howeve r, recent meta-analyses of these approaches \nreveal limited efficacy in treating EDs (Murray et al., 2019). The de arth of \nvariet y in treatment options for EDs has opened up an exciting opportunity for \nvariou s novel treatment options to overcome the current methods of treat-\nment. As suc h, the current field of research in EDs has begun expanding into \ndiffer ent novel methods of treatment.\nA rece nt literature review overviewing neurosurgical and neuromodulatory \nproced ures to target EDs—specifically AN—has shown promising evidence of \ntheir value as future treatment options (Murray et al., 2022). The li terature \nreview assessed 20 different trials of various brain-based neuromodulatory \ninterv entions for severe and chronic AN, including stereotactic ablation, deep \nbrain stimulation (DBS), rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) \nand tD CS (transcranial direct current stimulation). Cumula tively, this emer-\nging e vidence base suggests that stereotactic ablation and DBS show promising \nresult s, while rTMS and tDCS showed modest and mixed results. While this \nreview acknowledges the relatively low sample size of studies, which limits the \ngenera lizability of the efficacy of the novel treatments, this review also notes \nthe ab sence of long-term follow-up data, which is critical in documenting the \nlong-t erm effects of each intervention, respectively.

E. FRE IDL ICH ET AL.\n\nAlong side brain-based interventions, one other novel treatments over-\nviewed i n Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment & Prevention in 2022 \nrelates to high-calorie refeeding (HCR) in AN, which attempts to quickly and \neffectiv ely restore a patient’s weight while successfully mitigating the risk for \nrefeedin g syndrome. Initial treatments using a rapid refeeding approach \ndemonstr ated increased levels of anxiety in AN patients, although the level \nof anxie ty plateaued and normalized throughout the duration of the inpatient \ntreatmen t (Kezelman et al., 2016). A study by Akgül et al. (2022) assessed \nadolesce nts and young adults who were hospitalized with AN and malnutri-\ntion-rel ated sequelae. The HCR protocol provided three meals and three \nsnacks a day, with a nasogastric tube given as needed. Contrary to the initial \nbelief t hat rapid refeeding and HCR would increase levels of patient distress, \nthis pil ot study demonstrated no significant increase in anxiety throughout the \nrefeedin g process. In conce rt with the reduced length of admission character-\nistic of HCR protocols, these data further underscore the utility of this \napproach and support the potential implementation of rapid refeeding as \na novel method of administering HCR while avoiding refeeding syndrome.\nThe role of exercise in treatment\nExercise can play a complex role in the psychopathology and treatment of EDs. \nMore bro adly, exercise is widely accepted and supported as a healthy means to \ncope wit h stress and improve overall physical health. Even in the context of \npsychopa thology, evidence outside of the field indicates that both high and \nlow-inte nsity physical activity is effective in reducing the risk of depression \n(Mammen & Faulkner, 2013; Teychenne et al., 2008) which is highly comorbid \nwith EDs . However, some individuals with EDs experience maladaptive exer-\ncise-rel ated cognitions and behaviors, which can give rise to compulsive \nexercise , which may be used as a means to control weight or burn off calories. \nThis can lead to an unhealthy preoccupation with exercise, and can ultimately \nworsen E D symptoms. Compulsi ve exercise is often described as a rigid and \nhighly-d riven urge to exercise, associated with a perceived inability to cease \nexercisi ng regardless of the risk of harmful consequences (Noetel et al., 2017).\nIn cases where compulsive exercise may be a contributing factor to eating \npsychopa thology, addressing this behavior can be a key component of treat-\nment. Th is may include helping the individual understand the role of exercise \nin their disorder, developing a more balanced and healthy relationship with \nexercise , and providing guidance on how to engage in safe and appropriate \nlevels o f physical activity. For inst ance, previous evidence suggests that when \nused wit h caution, weight-bearing exercise can be protective of bone mineral \ndensity for adolescents with AN (Nagata et al., 2019). Neverthe less, there are \ncurrentl y no standardized guidelines for treating compulsive exercise or \nEATING D ISORDERS131\n\na consensus on which forms of treatment are most effective (Hallward et al., \n2022).\nIn more cl osely assessing the potential role of exercise in the treatment of \nBED, Smith et al. (2022) examined temporal associations between physical \nactivity ( PA), affective functioning, and eating-related cognitions and beha-\nviors in p atients with binge-eating disorders, measured via ecological momen-\ntary asses sment (EMA). BED is ass ociated with obesity, elevated risk of \ndiabetes, and emotional dysregulation (McCuen-Wurst et al., 2018), and little \nis known a bout how physical activity can improve symptomatology and \nemotional functioning in daily life.

BED is ass ociated with obesity, elevated risk of \ndiabetes, and emotional dysregulation (McCuen-Wurst et al., 2018), and little \nis known a bout how physical activity can improve symptomatology and \nemotional functioning in daily life. After one week of EMA, results suggest \nthat patie nts who reported higher levels of physical activity had more adaptive \naffective functioning (i.e., higher positive affect and higher body satisfaction) \nand eating regulation, as reflected by lower overeating. However, t his effect \nwas not si gnificant for loss of control eating (LOC), craving, or negative \nemotionali ty (i.e., negative affect and emotion regulation difficulties), and \nwithin-sub ject effects were not significant in any model. (Smith et al., 2022). \nThis study is impactful in that it is the first to demonstrate links between \nphysical a ctivity and naturalistic eating behavior in BED, specifically over-\neating (Sm ith et al., 2022). Though the findings highlight the importance of \nphysical a ctivity for BED patients, it is necessary for future research to identify \nthe durati on and type of exercise using objective measurements of PA and to \nconsider p hysical inactivity as a potential treatment target in this population.\nRelatedly, a systematic review from Hallward et al. (2022) which included \n11 studies , assessed methods to target the reduction of both compulsive \nexercise a nd eating psychopathology mainly among females with AN and \nBN. Each p arti cipant was diagnosed with AN, BN, or an eating disorder not \notherwise specified (EDNOS), and a small portion of BED. All studie s used \npsychoeduc ation to address participants’ attitudes, beliefs, and thoughts about \nexercise. Focus on p sychoeducation helps individuals recognize and reduce \nnegative a ttitudes and beliefs around exercise and develop a more positive and \nhealthy re lationship with it. The studie s predominantly approached and trea-\nted compul sive exercise mainly through exercise psychoeducation, although in \nsome insta nces, supervised sessions of exercise were also deployed. The find- ings show that eating psychopathology was reduced across all studies, suggest-\ning that t argeting compulsive exercise should be a core component of all ED \ntreatment (Hallward et al., 2022).\nTaken toge ther, these somewhat contrasting findings suggest that while \ncompulsive exercise should be therapeutically targeted and ameliorated in \ntreatment for all EDs, yet suggest that supervised and non-compulsive exercise \nmay have a role to play in limiting the propensity for compulsive exercise, \nwhile also offering additional avenues for affect regulation.\n132C.

(2022) set out to elucidate the precise factors leading patients \nto have PTT using secondary data analysis on 6024 treatment-seeking adults’ \nin higher-le vel care treatment settings, who met DSM-5 criteria for AN. It was \nreve aled tha t there were no differences found in the proportion of individuals \nwho had PTT based on PTT type (i.e., routine, administrative, patient/parent \nrequest, aga inst medical advice (AMA), or resource constraint), but findings \ndid show tha t participants enrolled in an inpatient treatment program were \nmore likely to have a non-routine discharge (Gorrell et al., 2022). While \nspecu lative, the authors suggest that this may be influenced by more intensive \ntreatment po ssibly not having as much coverage by insurance, or the greater \nseverity of illness influencing treatment engagement among patients. In keep-\ning with thi s, participants with heightened binge eating (BE) at admission and \nlower levels of cognitive restraint were more likely to be discharged by \nadministrati ve request and AMA (Gorrell et al., 2022). This finding may be \ndue in part to those with BE experiencing heightened distress as a result of \ntreatment, a nd those with lower cognitive restraint scores believing they are \nwell enough to leave care—though often untrue (Gorrell et al., 2022).\nFollowing pa tient discharge from intensive ED treatment, the maintenance \nof therapeut ic techniques and progress is imperative to supporting longer- \nterm remissi on. Open weighin g is a procedure commonly implemented in \ncognitive be havioral therapy (CBT) and family-based treatment (FBT) for EDs \nto discuss t he patient’s weight openly each week with a therapist (Wagner \net al., 2022 ). This approac h to monitoring and exposing patients to their \nweight has b een found over time to decrease distress, increase the patient’s \ncomfort with weight change, and improve weight-related cognitive distortions \n(Waller & Mo untford, 2015). Alternativel y, blind weighing in which a patient’s \nweight is no t disclosed to them is more often used in the treatment of AN \n(Kelly-Weede r et al., 2018), especially when patients are undergoing refeeding \nprotocols in which they are gaining weight at a more rapid pace than they may \nbe able to p sychologically tolerate (Murray et al., 2016).\nA study by W agner et al. (2022) examined adult patients, adolescent \npatients, an d the parents of patients with AN, BN, and other specified feeding \nEATING DISOR DERS133\n\nand eating disorders preferences for either a blind or open-weighing treatment \nprotocol. The results de monstrate that most patients initially have more \nfavorable view s of blind weighing versus open weighing in the short term, \nbut the differ ences in long-term effectiveness were insignificant. With regard \nt o differences in age cohorts, adolescent patients preferred blind weighing \nwhile about tw o-thirds of adult patients preferred open weighing (Wagner \net al., 2022). The study also revealed that past experience with either method of \nweighing corre sponded with more favorable views of the particular treatment \nthe patient re ceived. In addition, i t is theorized that participants may be more \nfavorable to t he weighing protocol they deem insufficient so as to maintain \na level of con trol over their condition that could be possible with open \nweighing, per se (Froreich et al., 2020).

In this vein, it is critical that clinicians \nare aware of t his possibility and that further research investigates how patient \nperceptions of weighing interventions affect treatment outcomes and relapse.\nWith such high relapse rates in EDs spanning BED, BN, and AN, mitigating \nrelapse risk i s essential, and maintaining treatment outcomes through specia-\nlized interven tions can be a vital way of supporting remission. To understand the efficacy o f different maintenance treatments, MacDonald et al. (2022) \ncompar ed a gro up-based intensive outpatient program (IOP) with individual \nCBT for EDs. T he group-base d maintenance treatment included one sup-\nported meal an d up to five group therapy sessions a week for 16 weeks in \nwhich particip ants were expected to continue adhering to their prescribed \nmeal plan and use tools targeted toward keeping up with newly learned \nbehaviors. The CBT mainte nance program focused on relapse prevention, \ncognitive rest ructuring, and inducing a greater sense of autonomy in the \nparticipants t hrough 16 sessions over the span of 14 weeks. Using \na retro spectiv e sequential cohort design, the participants had previously \nbeen involved in intensive day treatment or inpatient treatment programs at \nthe investigat ors’ Centre for Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada. The patients met criteria f or either anorexia nervosa, restrictive subtype (AN-R), anorexia \nnervosa, binge and purge subtype (AN-BP), bulimia nervosa (BN), or purging \ndisorder (PD) in which they achieved at least partial remission (MacDonald \net al., 2022). There were no differential outcomes found between the two maintenance \ntreatments. Ea ch treatment had similar trajectories of patients’ symptoms \nreturning to a clinically significant level adjusted for differences between ED \ndiagnoses (Mac Donald et al., 2022). In other words , of the 51.6% of patients \nwho returned t o clinically significant symptoms by the 12-month follow-up, \nthe type of ma intenance treatment they received was an insignificant predictor \nof their relap se. The investigat ors state the lack of difference between main-\ntenance treatm ents can be seen as a function of the group-based IOP cohort \nspending more time in therapy, thus balancing out the highly personalized and \noften more eff ective outcomes of CBT. In sum, the st udy concludes that while \n134C. E.

However, recent evidence shows that when used with caution, exercise \ncan be an import ant part of the treatment. Moreover, in the last year evidence \nillustrates that controlled physical activity may be useful in treating body satisfac-\ntion and overeat ing in BED (Smith et al., 2022), and can also be useful in treating \ncompulsive exerc ise in AN and BN when paired with psychoeducation (Hallward \net al., 2022). T he challenge fo r the field looking ahead is establishing ways in \nwhich exercise c an be healthfully integrated into ED treatment, mitigating the risk \nfor relapse as o pposed to becoming a weight-control mechanism.\nLastly, with the first months after ED treatment being robustly character-\nized by a height ened risk for relapse, this is a sensitive time that necessitates \ndischarge planni ng and maintenance treatment protocols of the highest caliber \nto ensure patien ts reach remission. Additionally, on ce a patient is discharged \nfrom treatment, in order to avoid relapsing to clinically significant levels, \nmaintenance inte rventions should be employed to help individuals adhere to \ntheir newly lear ned behaviors and maintain the progress of treatment. \nDifferent types of maintenance treatments such as CBT and group-based \ntreatments need further study as well as the continued assessment of blind \nversus open weig hing protocols.
